PREFACE.

The following Essays are re-printed in
the chronological order of their delivery.
They will, therefore, help to show something
of the progress of Eugenics during the last
few years, and to explain my own views upon
its aims and methods, which often have been,
and still sometimes are, absurdly misrepresented.
The practice of Eugenics has already
obtained a considerable hold on popular
estimation, and is steadily acquiring the status
of a practical question, and not that of a
mere vision in Utopia.

The power by which Eugenic reform
must chiefly be effected, is that of Popular
Opinion, which is amply strong enough for
that purpose whenever it shall be roused.
Public Opinion has done as much as this on
many past occasions and in various countries,
of which much evidence is given in the Essay
on Restrictions in Marriage. It is now ordering
our acts more intimately than we are apt
to suspect, because the dictates of Public
Opinion become so thoroughly assimilated
that they seem to be original and individual
.bn f004.png
to those who are guided by them. By comparing
the current ideas at widely different
epochs and under widely different civilizations
we are able to ascertain what part of our convictions
is really innate and permanent, and
what part has been acquired and is transient.

It is above all things needful for the
successful progress of Eugenics that its
advocates should move discreetly and claim
no more efficacy on its behalf than the future
will confirm; otherwise a re-action will be
invited. A great deal of investigation is
still needed to shew the limit of practical
Eugenics, yet enough has been already
determined to justify large efforts to instruct
the public in an authoritative way, as to the
results hitherto obtained by sound reasoning,
applied to the undoubted facts of social
experience.

My best thanks are due to the Editor of
Nature, to the Council of the Sociological
Society, and to the Clarendon Press of
Oxford, for permission to reprint those among
the following essays that first appeared in
their Publications.

In fulfilling the honourable charge that has
been entrusted to me of delivering the Huxley
lecture, I shall endeavour to carry out what
I understand to have been the wish of its
founders, namely, to treat broadly some new
topic belonging to a class in which Huxley
himself would have felt a keen interest, rather
than to expatiate on his character and the
work of his noble life.

That which I have selected for to-night is
one which has occupied my thoughts for many
years, and to which a large part of my
published inquiries have borne a direct though
silent reference. Indeed, the remarks I am
about to make would serve as an additional
chapter to my books on “Hereditary Genius”
and on “Natural Inheritance.” My subject
will be the possible improvement of the human
race under the existing conditions of law and
sentiment. It has not hitherto been approached
.bn p002.png
.pn +1
along the ways that recent knowledge
has laid open, and it occupies in consequence
a less dignified position in scientific estimation
than it might. It is smiled at as most
desirable in itself and possibly worthy of
academic discussion, but absolutely out of
the question as a practical problem. My aim
in this lecture is to show cause for a different
opinion. Indeed I hope to induce anthropologists
to regard human improvement as a
subject that should be kept openly and squarely
in view, not only on account of its transcendent
importance, but also because it affords excellent
but neglected fields for investigation. I
shall show that our knowledge is already
sufficient to justify the pursuit of this perhaps
the grandest of all objects, but that we know
less of the conditions upon which success
depends than we might and ought to ascertain.
The limits of our knowledge and of our
ignorance will become clearer as we proceed.

<i>Human Variety.</i>—The natural character
and faculties of human beings differ at least
as widely as those of the domesticated animals,
such as dogs and horses, with whom we are
familiar. In disposition some are gentle and
good-tempered, others surly and vicious; some
are courageous, others timid; some are eager,
others sluggish; some have large powers of
endurance, others are quickly fatigued; some
are muscular and powerful, others are weak;
some are intelligent, others stupid; some have
tenacious memories of places and persons,
.bn p003.png
.pn +1
others frequently stray and are slow at recognising.
The number and variety of aptitudes,
especially in dogs, is truly remarkable; among
the most notable being the tendency to herd
sheep, to point and to retrieve. So it is with
the various natural qualities that go towards
the making of civic worth in man. Whether
it be in character, disposition, energy, intellect,
or physical power, we each receive at our
birth a definite endowment, allegorised by the
parable related in St. Matthew, some receiving
many talents, others few; but each person
being responsible for the profitable use of that
which has been entrusted to him.

<i>Distribution of Qualities in a Nation.</i>—Experience
shows that while talents are distributed
in endless different degrees, the
frequency of those different degrees follows
certain statistical laws, of which the best
known is the Normal Law of Frequency.
This is the result whenever variations are due
to the combined action of many small and
different causes, whatever may be the causes
and whatever the object in which the variations
occur, just as twice 2 always makes 4,
whatever the objects may be. It therefore
holds true with approximate precision for
variables of totally different sorts, as, for
instance, stature of man, errors made by
astronomers in judging minute intervals of
time, bullet marks around the bull’s-eye in
target practice, and differences of marks
gained by candidates at competitive examinations.
.bn p004.png
.pn +1
There is no mystery about the
fundamental principles of this abstract law; it
rests on such simple fundamental conceptions
as, that if we toss two pence in the air
they will, in the long run, come down one
head and one tail twice as often as both heads
or both tails. I will assume then, that the
talents, so to speak, that go to the formation
of civic worth are distributed with rough
approximation according to this familiar law.
In doing so, I in no way disregard the admirable
work of Prof. Karl Pearson on the
distribution of qualities, for which he was
adjudged the Darwin Medal of the Royal
Society a few years ago. He has amply
proved that we must not blindly trust the
Normal Law of Frequency; in fact, that
when variations are minutely studied they
rarely fall into that perfect symmetry about
the mean value which is one of its consequences.
Nevertheless, my conscience is
clear in using this law in the way I am about
to. I say that <em>if</em> certain qualities vary
normally, such and such will be the results;
that these qualities are of a class that are
found, whenever they have been tested, to
vary normally to a fair degree of approximation,
and consequently we may infer that our
results are trustworthy indications of real
facts.

A talent is a sum whose exact value few
of us care to know, although we all appreciate
the inner sense of the beautiful parable. I
.bn p005.png
.pn +1
will, therefore, venture to adapt the phraseology
of the allegory to my present purpose by
substituting for “talent” the words “normal-talent.”
The value of this normal talent in
respect to each and any specified quality or
faculty is such that one-quarter of the people
receive for their respective shares more than
one normal-talent <em>over and above</em> the average
of all the shares. Our normal-talent is therefore
identical with what is technically known
as the “probable error.” Therefrom the
whole of the following table starts into life,
evolved from that of the “<em>probability integral</em>.”
It expresses the distribution of any normal
quality, or any group of normal qualities,
among 10,000 persons in terms of the
normal-talent. The M in the upper line
occupies the position of Mediocrity, or that of
the average of what all have received: the
+1°, +2°, etc., and the –1°, –2°, etc., refer to
normal talents. These numerals stand as
.bn p006.png
.pn +1
graduations at the heads of the vertical lines
by which the table is divided. The entries
between the divisions are the numbers per
10,000 of those who receive sums between the
amounts specified by those divisions. Thus,
by the hypothesis, 2500 receive more than M
but less than M +1°, 1613 receive more than
M +1° but less than M +2°, and so on. The
terminals have only an inner limit, thus 35
receive more than 4°, some to perhaps a very
large and indefinite amount. The divisions
might have been carried much farther, but
the numbers in the classes between them
would become less and less trustworthy. The
left half of the series exactly reflects the right
half. As it will be useful henceforth to
distinguish these classes, I have used the
<em>capital</em> or large letters R, S, T, U, V, for those
above mediocrity and corresponding <em>italic</em> or
small letters, <i>r</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, for those below
mediocrity, <i>r</i> being the counterpart of R, <i>s</i> of
S, and so on.

It will assist in comprehending the values
of different grades of civic worth to compare
them with the corresponding grades of adult
male stature in our nation. I will take the
figures from my “Natural Inheritance,” premising
that the distribution of stature in
various peoples has been well investigated and
shown to be closely normal. The average
.bn p007.png
.pn +1
height of the adult males, to whom my figures
refer, was nearly 5 feet 8 inches, and the value
of their “normal-talent” (which is a measure
of the spread of distribution) was very nearly
1–3/4 inches. From these data it is easily
reckoned that Class U would contain men
whose heights exceed 6 feet 1–1/4 inches. Even
they are tall enough to overlook a hatless
mob, while the higher classes, such as V, W
and X, tower above it in an increasingly
marked degree. So the civic worth (however
that term may be defined) of U-class men,
and still more of V-class, are notably superior
to the crowd, though they are far below the
heroic order. The rarity of a V-class man in
each specified quality or group of qualities is
as 35 in 10,000, or say, for the convenience of
using round numbers, as 1 to 300. A man of
the W class is ten times rarer, and of the X class
rarer still; but I shall avoid giving any more
exact definition of X than as a value considerably
rarer than V. This gives a general but
just idea of the distribution throughout a
population of each and every quality taken
separately so far as it is normally distributed.
As already mentioned, it does the same for
<em>any</em> group of normal qualities; thus, if marks
for classics and for mathematics were severally
normal in their distribution, the combined
marks gained by each candidate in both those
subjects would be distributed normally also,
this being one of the many interesting properties
of the law of frequency.

<i>Comparison of the Normal Classes with those
of Mr. Booth.</i>—Let us now compare the normal
classes with those into which Mr. Charles Booth
has divided the population of all London in a
way that corresponds not unfairly with the
ordinary conception of grades of civic worth.
He reckons them from the lowest upwards,
and gives the numbers in each class for East
London. Afterwards he treats all London in
a similar manner, except that sometimes he
combines two classes into one and gives the
joint result. For my present purpose, I had
to couple them somewhat differently, first disentangling
them as I best could. There
seemed no better way of doing this than by
assigning to the members of each couplet the
same proportions that they had in East
London. Though this was certainly not
accurate, it is probably not far wrong. Mr.
Booth has taken unheard of pains in this
great work of his to arrive at accurate results,
but he emphatically says that his classes cannot
be separated sharply from one another.
On the contrary, their frontiers blend, and
this justifies me in taking slight liberties with
his figures. His class A consists of criminals,
semi-criminals, loafers and some others, who
are in number at the rate of 1 per cent. in all
London—that is 100 per 10,000, or nearly
three times as many as the <i>v</i> class: they
therefore include the whole of <i>v</i> and spread
upwards into the <i>u</i>. His class B consists of
very poor persons who subsist on casual
.bn p009.png
.bn p010.png
.pn +2
earnings, many of whom are inevitably poor
from shiftlessness, idleness or drink. The
numbers in this and the A class combined
closely correspond with those in <i>t</i> and all
below <i>t</i>.

Class C are supported by intermittent
earnings; they are a hard-working people, but
have a very bad character for improvidence
and shiftlessness. In Class D the earnings
are regular, but at the low rate of twenty-one
shillings or less a week, so none of them rise
above poverty, though none are very poor.
D and C together correspond to the whole of
<i>s</i> combined with the lower fifth of <i>r</i>. The
next class, E, is the largest of any, and comprises
all those with regular standard earnings
of twenty-two to thirty shillings a week. This
class is the recognised field for all forms of
co-operation and combination; in short for
trades unions. It corresponds to the upper
four-fifths of <i>r</i>, combined with the lower
four-fifths of R. It is therefore essentially
the mediocre class, standing as far below the
highest in civic worth as it stands above the
lowest class with its criminals and semi-criminals.
Next above this large mass of
mediocrity comes the honourable class <i>F</i>,
which consists of better paid artisans and
foremen. These are able to provide adequately
for old age, and their sons become clerks and
so forth. <i>G</i> is the lower middle class of shopkeepers,
small employers, clerks and subordinate
professional men, who as a rule are
.bn p011.png
.pn +1
hard-working, energetic and sober. F and G
combined correspond to the upper fifth of R
and the whole of S, and are, therefore, a
counterpart to D and C. All above G are put
together by Mr. Booth into one class H, which
corresponds to our T, U, V and above, and
is the counterpart of his two lowermost classes,
A and B. So far, then, as these figures go,
civic worth is distributed in fair approximation
to the normal law of frequency. We also
see that the classes <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i> and below are
undesirables.

<i>Worth of Children.</i>—The brains of the
nation lie in the higher of our classes. If
such people as would be classed W or X could
be distinguishable as children and procurable
by money in order to be reared as Englishmen,
it would be a cheap bargain for the
nation to buy them at the rate of many
hundred or some thousands of pounds per
head. Dr. Farr, the eminent statistician,
endeavoured to estimate the money worth of
an average baby born to the wife of an Essex
labourer and thenceforward living during the
usual time and in the ordinary way of his
class. Dr. Farr, with accomplished actuarial
skill, capitalised the value at the child’s birth
of two classes of events, the one the cost of
maintenance while a child and when helpless
through old age, the other its earnings as boy
and man. On balancing the two sides of the
account the value of the baby was found to be
five pounds. On a similar principle, the
.bn p012.png
.pn +1
worth of an X-class baby would be reckoned
in thousands of pounds. Some such “talented”
folk fail, but most succeed, and many succeed
greatly. They found great industries, establish
vast undertakings, increase the wealth of
multitudes and amass large fortunes for themselves.
Others, whether they be rich or poor,
are the guides and light of the nation, raising
its tone, enlightening its difficulties and
imposing its ideals. The great gain that
England received through the immigration of
the Huguenots would be insignificant to what
she would derive from an annual addition of
a few hundred children of the classes W and
X. I have tried, but not yet succeeded to
my satisfaction, to make an approximate
estimate of the worth of a child at birth
according to the class he is destined to occupy
when adult. It is an eminently important
subject for future investigators, for the amount
of care and cost that might profitably be
expended in improving the race clearly
depends on its result.

<i>Descent of Qualities in a Population.</i>—Let
us now endeavour to obtain a correct understanding
of the way in which the varying
qualities of each generation are derived from
those of its predecessor. How many, for
example, of the V class in the offspring come
respectively from the V, U, T, S and other
classes of parentage? The means of calculating
this question for a normal population
are given fully in my “Natural Inheritance.”
.bn p013.png
.pn +1
There are three main senses in which the
word parentage might be used. They differ
widely, so the calculations must be modified
accordingly, (1) The amount of the quality
or faculty in question may be known in each
parent. (2) It may be known in only one
parent. (3) The two parents may belong to
the same class, a V-class father in the scale
of male classification always marrying a V-class
mother, occupying identically the same
position in the scale of female classification.

I select this last case to work out as being
the one with which we shall here be chiefly
concerned. It has the further merit of
escaping some tedious preliminary details about
converting female faculties into their corresponding
male equivalents, before men and
women can be treated statistically on equal
terms. I shall assume in what follows that
we are dealing with an ideal population, in
which all marriages are equally fertile, and
which is statistically the same in successive
generations both in numbers and in qualities,
so many per cent. being always this, so many
always that, and so on. Further, I shall take
no notice of offspring who die before they
reach the age of marriage, nor shall I regard
the slight numerical inequality of the sexes,
but will simply suppose that each parentage
produces one couplet of grown-up filials, an
adult man and an adult woman.

<em>Note.</em>—The agreement in distribution between fathers (or <i>mothers</i>) and sons (or <i>daughters</i>) is exact to the nearest whole per centage. The slight discrepancy in the ten-thousandths is mainly due to the classes being too few and too wide; theoretically they should be extremely numerous and narrow.

The result is shown to the nearest whole

to the nearest ten thousands. They may be
read either as applying to fathers and their
sons when adult, or to mothers and their
daughters when adult, or, again, to parentages
and filial couplets. I will not now attempt to
explain the details of the calculation to those
to whom these methods are new. Those who
are familiar with them will easily understand
the exact process from what follows. There
are three points of reference in a scheme of
descent which may be respectively named
“mid-parental,” “genetic” and “filial”
centres. In the present case of both parents
being alike, the position of the mid-parental
centre is identical with that of either parent
separately. The position of the filial centre
is that from which the children disperse. The
genetic centre occupies the same position in
the parental series that the filial centre does
in the filial series. “Natural Inheritance”
contains abundant proof, both observational
and theoretical, that the genetic centre is not
and cannot be identical with the parental centre,
but is always more mediocre, owing to the
combination of ancestral influences—which are
generally mediocre—with the purely parental
ones. It also shows that the regression from
the parental to the genetic centre, in the case
of stature at least, would amount to two-thirds
under the conditions we are now supposing.
The regression is indicated in the diagram
used to illustrate this paper, by converging
lines which are directed towards the same
.bn p016.png
.pn +1
point below, but are stopped at one-third
of the distance on the way to it. The
contents of each parental class are supposed to
be concentrated at the foot of the median axis
of that class, this being the vertical line that
divides its contents into equal parts. Its
position is approximately, but not exactly,
half-way between the divisions that bound it,
and is as easily calculated for the extreme
classes, which have no outer terminals, as for
any of the others. These median points are
respectively taken to be the positions of the
parental centres of the whole of each of the
classes; therefore the positions attained by
the converging lines that proceed from them
at the points where they are stopped, represent
the genetic centres. From these the filials
disperse to the right and left with a “spread”
that can be shown to be three-quarters that
of the parentages. Calculation easily determines
the number of the filials that fall into
the class in which the filial centre is situated,
and of those that spread into the classes on
each side. When the parental contributions
from all the classes to each filial class are
added together they will express the distribution
of the quality among the whole of the
offspring. Now it will be observed in the
table that the numbers in the classes of the
offspring are identical with those of the parents,
when they are reckoned to the nearest whole
percentage, as should be the case according
to the hypothesis. Had the classes been
.bn p017.png
.pn +1
narrower and more numerous, and if the
calculations had been carried on to two more
places of decimals, the correspondence would
have been identical to the nearest ten-thousandth.
It was unnecessary to take the
trouble of doing this, as the table affords a
sufficient basis for what I am about to say.
Though it does not profess to be more than
approximately true in detail, it is certainly
trustworthy in its general form, including as
it does the effects of regression, filial dispersion,
and the equation that connects a
parental generation with a filial one when
they are statistically alike. Minor corrections
will be hereafter required, and can be applied
when we have a better knowledge of the
material. In the meantime it will serve as
a standard table of descent from each generation
of a people to its successor.

<i>Economy of Effort.</i>—I shall now use the
table to show the economy of concentrating
our attention upon the highest classes. We
will therefore trace the origin of the V class—which
is the highest in the table. Of its 34
or 35 sons, 6 come from V parentages, 10
from U, 10 from T, 5 from S, 3 from R, and
none from any class below R. But the
numbers of the contributing parentages have
also to be taken into account. When this is
done, we see that the lower classes make
their scores owing to their quantity and not
to their quality; for while 35 V-class parents
.bn p018.png
.pn +1
suffice to produce 6 sons of the V class, it
takes 2500 R-class fathers to produce 3 of
them. Consequently the richness in produce
of V-class parentages is to that of the R-class
in an inverse ratio, or as 143 to 1. Similarly,
the richness in produce of V-class children
from parentages of the classes U, T, S, respectively,
is as 3, 11–1/2, and 55, to 1. Moreover,
nearly one-half of the produce of V-class
parentages are V or U taken together, and
nearly three-quarters of them are either V, U
or T. If then we desire to increase the output
of V-class offspring, by far the most profitable
parents to work upon would be those of the
V-class, and in a threefold less degree those
of the U class.

When both parents are of the V class the
quality of parentages is greatly superior to
those in which only one parent is a V. In
that case the regression of the genetic centre
goes twice as far back towards mediocrity,
and the spread of the distribution among
filials becomes nine-tenths of that among the
parents, instead of being only three-quarters.
The effect is shown in table IV.

There is a difference of fully two divisions
in the position of the genetic centre, that of
the single V parentage being only a trifle
nearer mediocrity than that of the double T.
Hence it would be bad economy to spend
much effort in furthering marriages with a
higher class on only one side.

<i>Marriage of like to like.</i>—In each class of
society there is a strong tendency to intermarriage,
which produces a marked effect in
the richness of brain power of the more
cultured families. It produces a still more
marked effect of another kind at the lowest
step of the social scale, as will be painfully
evident from the following extracts from the
work of Mr. C. Booth (i. 38), which refer to
his Class A, who form, as has been said, the
lowermost third of our “<i>v</i> and below.” “Their
life is the life of savages, with vicissitudes of
extreme hardship and occasional excess.
From them come the battered figures who
slouch through the streets and play the
beggar or the bully. They render no useful
service, they create no wealth; more often
they destroy it. They degrade whatever they
.bn p020.png
.pn +1
touch, and as individuals are perhaps incapable
of improvement ... but I do not
mean to say that there are not individuals of
every sort to be found in the mass. Those
who are able to wash the mud may find some
gems in it. There are at any rate many very
piteous cases. Whatever doubt there may
be as to the exact numbers of this class, it is
certain that they bear a very small proportion
to the rest of the population, or even
to class B, with which they are mixed up and
from which it is at times difficult to separate
them.... They are barbarians, but they
are a handful....” He says further, “It
is much to be desired and to be hoped that
this class may become less hereditary in its
character; there appears to be no doubt that
it is now hereditary to a very considerable
extent.”

Many who are familiar with the habits of
these people do not hesitate to say that it
would be an economy and a great benefit to
the country if all habitual criminals were
resolutely segregated under merciful surveillance
and peremptorily denied opportunities
for producing offspring. It would abolish a
source of suffering and misery to a future
generation, and would cause no unwarrantable
hardship in this.

<i>Diplomas.</i>—It will be remembered that
Mr. Booth’s classification did not help us
beyond classes higher than S in civic worth.
If a strong and widely felt desire should arise
.bn p021.png
.pn +1
to discover young men whose position was of
the V, W or X order, there would not be
much difficulty in doing so. Let us imagine,
for a moment, what might be done in any
great University, where the students are in
continual competition in studies, in athletics,
or in public meetings, and where their
characters are publicly known to associates
and to tutors. Before attempting to make a
selection, acceptable definitions of civic worth
would have to be made in alternative terms,
for there are many forms of civic worth. The
number of men of the V, W or X classes
whom the University was qualified to contribute
annually must also be ascertained.
As was said, the proportion in the general
population of the V class to the remainder is
as 1 to 300, and that of the W class as 1 in
3000. But students are a somewhat selected
body because the cleverest youths, in a
scholastic sense, usually find their way to
Universities. A considerably high level, both
intellectually and physically, would be required
as a qualification for candidature.
The limited number who had not been
automatically weeded away by this condition
might be submitted in some appropriate way
to the independent votes of fellow-students
on the one hand, and of tutors on the
other, whose ideals of character and merit
necessarily differ. This ordeal would reduce
the possible winners to a very small number,
out of which an independent committee might
.bn p022.png
.pn +1
be trusted to make the ultimate selection.
They would be guided by personal interviews.
They would take into consideration all
favourable points in the family histories of the
candidates, giving appropriate hereditary
weight to each. Probably they would agree
to pass over unfavourable points, unless they
were notorious and flagrant, owing to the
great difficulty of ascertaining the real truth
about them. Ample experience in making
selections has been acquired even by scientific
societies, most of which work well, including
perhaps the award of their medals, which the
fortunate recipients at least are tempted to
consider judicious. The opportunities for
selecting women in this way are unfortunately
fewer, owing to the smaller number of female
students between whom comparisons might be
made on equal terms. In the selection of
women, when nothing is known of their
athletic proficiency, it would be especially
necessary to pass a high and careful medical
examination; and as their personal qualities
do not usually admit of being tested so
thoroughly as those of men, it would be
necessary to lay all the more stress on
hereditary family qualities, including those of
fertility and prepotency.

<i>Correlation between Promise in Youth and
subsequent Performance.</i>—No serious difficulty
seems to stand in the way of classifying and
giving satisfactory diplomas to youths of
either sex, supposing there were a strong
.bn p023.png
.pn +1
demand for it. But some real difficulty does
lie in the question—Would such a classification
be a trustworthy forecast of qualities in
later life? The scheme of descent of
qualities may hold good between the parents
and the offspring at similar ages, but that is
not the information we really want. It is the
descent of qualities from men to men, not from
youths to youths. The accidents that make
or mar a career do not enter into the scope of
this difficulty. It resides entirely in the fact
that the development does not cease at the
time of youth, especially in the higher natures,
but that faculties and capabilities which were
then latent subsequently unfold and become
prominent. Putting aside the effects of
serious illness, I do not suppose there is any
risk of retrogression in capacity before old age
comes on. The mental powers that a youth
possesses continue with him as a man; but
other faculties and new dispositions may arise
and alter the balance of his character. He
may cease to be efficient in the way of which
he gave promise, and he may perhaps become
efficient in unexpected directions.

The correlation between youthful promise
and performance in mature life has never
been properly investigated. Its measurement
presents no greater difficulty, so far as I
can foresee, than in other problems which
have been successfully attacked. It is one of
those alluded to in the beginning of this
lecture as bearing on race-improvement, and
.bn p024.png
.pn +1
being on its own merits suitable for anthropological
inquiry. Let me add that I think
its neglect by the vast army of highly educated
persons who are connected with the present
huge system of competitive examinations to
be gross and unpardonable. Neither schoolmasters,
tutors, officials of the Universities,
nor of the State department of education,
have ever to my knowledge taken any serious
step to solve this important problem, though
the value of the present elaborate system of
examinations cannot be rightly estimated
until it is solved. When the value of the
correlation between youthful promise and
adult performance shall have been determined,
the figures given in the table of
descent will have to be reconsidered.

<i>Augmentation of Favoured Stock.</i>—The
possibility of improving the race of a nation
depends on the power of increasing the productivity
of the best stock. This is far more
important than that of repressing the productivity
of the worst. They both raise the
average, the latter by reducing the undesirables,
the former by increasing those who
will become the lights of the nation. It is
therefore all important to prove that favour to
selected individuals might so increase their
productivity as to warrant the expenditure in
money and care that would be necessitated.
An enthusiasm to improve the race would
probably express itself by granting diplomas
to a select class of young men and women, by
.bn p025.png
.pn +1
encouraging their intermarriages, by hastening
the time of marriage of women of that high
class, and by provision for rearing children
healthily. The means that might be
employed to compass these ends are dowries,
especially for those to whom moderate sums
are important, assured help in emergencies
during the early years of married life, healthy
homes, the pressure of public opinion, honours,
and above all the introduction of motives of
religious or quasi-religious character. Indeed,
an enthusiasm to improve the race is so noble
in its aim that it might well give rise to the
sense of a religious obligation. In other lands
there are abundant instances in which
religious motives make early marriages a
matter of custom, and continued celibacy to
be regarded as a disgrace, if not a crime.
The customs of the Hindoos, also of the Jews,
especially in ancient times, bear this out. In
all costly civilisations there is a tendency to
shrink from marriage on prudential grounds.
It would, however, be possible so to alter the
conditions of life that the most prudent
course for an X class person should lie
exactly opposite to its present direction, for
he or she might find that there were advantages
and not disadvantages in early
marriage, and that the most prudent course
was to follow the natural instincts.

We have now to consider the probable
gain in the number and worth of adult
offspring to these favoured couples. First
.bn p026.png
.pn +1
as regards the effect of reducing the age at
marriage. There is unquestionably a tendency
among cultured women to delay or even to
abstain from marriage; they dislike the
sacrifice of freedom and leisure, of opportunities
for study and of cultured companionship.
This has to be reckoned with. I
heard of the reply of a lady official of a
College for Women to a visitor who inquired
as to the after life of the students. She
answered that one-third profited by it,
another third gained little good, and a third
were failures. “But what become of the
failures?” “Oh, they marry.”

There appears to be a considerable
difference between the earliest age at which
it is physiologically desirable that a woman
should marry and that at which the ablest,
or at least the most cultured, women usually
do. Acceleration in the time of marriage,
often amounting to 7 years, as from 28 or 29
to 21 or 22, under influences such as those
mentioned above, is by no means improbable.
What would be its effect on productivity?
It might be expected to act in two ways:--

(1) By shortening each generation by an
amount roughly proportionate to the diminution
in age at which marriage occurs.
Suppose the span of each generation to be
shortened by one-sixth, so that six take the
place of five, and that the productivity of each
marriage is unaltered, it follows that one-sixth
more children will be brought into the
.bn p027.png
.pn +1
world during the same time, which is, roughly
equivalent to increasing the productivity of
an unshortened generation by that amount.

(2) By saving from certain barrenness the
earlier part of the child-bearing period of the
woman. Authorities differ so much as to the
direct gain of fertility due to early marriage
that it is dangerous to express an opinion.
The large and thriving families that I have
known were the offspring of mothers who
married very young.

The next influence to be considered is
that of healthy homes. These and a simple
life certainly conduce to fertility. They
also act indirectly by preserving lives that
would otherwise fail to reach adult age.
It is not necessarily the weakest who perish
in this way, for instance, zymotic disease
falls indiscriminately on the weak and the
strong.

Again, the children would be healthier
and therefore more likely in their turn to
become parents of a healthy stock. The
great danger to high civilisations, and
remarkably so to our own, is the exhaustive
drain upon the rural districts to supply
large towns. Those who come up to the
towns may produce large families, but there
is much reason to believe that these dwindle
away in subsequent generations. In short,
the towns sterilise rural vigour.

As one of the reasons for choosing the
selected class would be that of hereditary
.bn p028.png
.pn +1
fertility, it follows that the selected class
would respond more than other classes to
the above influences.

I do not attempt to appraise the strength
of the combined six influences just described.
If each added one-sixth to the produce the
number of offspring would be doubled.
This does not seem impossible considering
the large families of colonists, and of those
in many rural districts; but it is a high
estimate. Perhaps the fairest approximation
may be that these influences would cause
the X women to bring into the world an
average of one adult son and one adult
daughter <em>in addition</em> to what they would
otherwise have produced. The table of
descent applies to one son or to one daughter
per couple; it may now be read as specifying
the net gain and showing its distribution.
Should this estimate be thought too high,
the results may be diminished accordingly.

It is no absurd idea that outside influences
should hasten the age of marrying and make
it customary for the best to marry the best.
A superficial objection is sure to be urged
that the fancies of young people are so incalculable
and so irresistible that they cannot
be guided. No doubt they are so in some
exceptional cases. I lately heard from a lady
who belonged to a county family of position
that a great aunt of hers had scandalised her
own domestic circle two generations ago by
falling in love with the undertaker at her
.bn p029.png
.pn +1
father’s funeral and insisting on marrying him.
Strange vagaries occur, but considerations of
social position and of fortune, with frequent
opportunities of intercourse, tell much more
in the long run than sudden fancies that want
roots. In a community deeply impressed
with the desire of encouraging marriages
between persons of equally high ability, the
social pressure directed to produce the desired
end would be so great as to ensure a notable
amount of success.

.tb

<i>Profit and Loss.</i>—The problem to be
solved now assumes a clear shape. A child
of the X class (whatever X signifies) would
have been worth so and so at its birth, and
one of each of the other grades respectively
would have been worth so and so; 100 X
parentages can be made to produce a net gain
of 100 adult sons and 100 adult daughters who
will be distributed among the classes according
to the standard table of descent. The total
value of the prospective produce of the 100
parentages can then be estimated by an
actuary, and consequently the sum that it is
legitimate to spend in favouring an X parentage.
The clear and distinct statement of a
problem is often more than half way towards
its solution. There seems no reason why this
one should not be solved between limiting
values that are not too wide apart to be useful.

.tb

<i>Existing Activities.</i>—Leaving aside profitable
expenditure from a purely money point
.bn p030.png
.pn +1
of view, the existence should be borne in mind
of immense voluntary activities that have
nobler aims. The annual voluntary contributions
in the British Isles to public charities
alone amount, on the lowest computation, to
fourteen million pounds, a sum which Sir H.
Burdett asserts on good grounds is by no
means the maximum obtainable.[#]

.rj
(“Hospitals and Charities,” 1898, p. 85.)

There are other activities long since
existing which might well be extended. I
will not dwell, as I am tempted to do, on the
endowments of scholarships and the like,
which aim at finding and educating the fittest
youths for the work of the nation; but I will
refer to that wholesome practice during all
ages of wealthy persons interesting themselves
in and befriending poor but promising lads.
The number of men who have owed their
start in a successful life to help of this kind
must have struck every reader of biographies.
This relationship of befriender and befriended
.bn p031.png
.pn +1
is hardly to be expressed in English by a
simple word that does not connote more than
is intended. The word “patron” is odious.
Recollecting Dr. Johnson’s abhorrence of the
patrons of his day, I turned to an early
edition of his dictionary in hope of deriving
some amusement as well as instruction from
his definition of the word, and I was not disappointed.
He defines “patron” as “a
wretch who supports with insolence and is
repaid with flattery.” That is totally opposed
to what I would advocate, namely, a kindly
and honourable relation between a wealthy
man who has made his position in the world
and a youth who is avowedly his equal in
natural gifts, but who has yet to make it. It
is one in which each party may well take pride
and I feel sure that if its value were more
widely understood it would become commoner
than it is.

The 80 charitable bequests of and exceeding £9000,
made in 1808 alone, amounted to more than 3–1/2 millions of
pounds. (Whitaker’s Almanack to 1909, p. 433).

“It being far more humane to <em>prevent</em> suffering than to
<em>alleviate</em> it after it has occurred, why will not charitably disposed
persons leave substantial sums of money to the furtherance of
Eugenic Study and practice, and of popularising the result? The
money would be well bestowed.” <cite>Francis Galton, 1909.</cite>

I learn on high legal authority that the form of bequest
which would be most appropriate in present circumstances, and be
free from the pit-falls that lie in the way of charitable bequests,
is “I bequeath to my trusted friend A.B., of ....., absolutely,
the sum of £...... in the hope and confidence that he will apply
the same in furtherance of Eugenic Study and practice, but without
imposing on him any trust or legal obligation so to do.” F.G.
.fn-
.fs

Many degrees may be imagined that lie
between mere befriendment and actual
adoption, and which would be more or less
effective in freeing capable youths from the
hindrances of narrow circumstances; in
enabling girls to marry early and suitably,
and in securing favour for their subsequent
offspring. Something in this direction is
commonly but half unconsciously done by
many great landowners whose employments
for man and wife, together with good
cottages, are given to exceptionally deserving
couples. The advantage of being connected
.bn p032.png
.pn +1
with a great and liberally managed estate
being widely appreciated, there are usually
more applicants than vacancies, so selection
can be exercised. The consequence is that
the class of men found upon these properties
is markedly superior to those in similar
positions elsewhere. It might well become a
point of honour, and as much an avowed
object, for noble families to gather fine
specimens of humanity around them, as it is
to procure and maintain fine breeds of cattle
and so forth, which are costly, but repay in
satisfaction.

There is yet another existing form of
princely benevolence which might be so
extended as to exercise a large effect on race
improvement. I mean the provision to
exceptionally promising young couples of
healthy and convenient houses at low rentals.
A continually renewed settlement of this
kind can be easily imagined, free from the
taint of patronage, and analogous to colleges
with their self-elected fellowships and rooms
for residence, that should become an exceedingly
desirable residence for a specified
time. It would be so in the same way
that a good club by its own social advantages
attracts desirable candidates. The
tone of the place would be higher than
elsewhere, on account of the high quality
of the inmates, and it would be distinguished
by an air of energy, intelligence, health
and self-respect and by mutual helpfulness.

<i>Prospects.</i>—It is pleasant to contrive
Utopias, and I have indulged in many, of
which a great society is one, publishing
intelligence and memoirs, holding yearly
elections, administering large funds, establishing
personal relations like a missionary
society with its missionaries, keeping elaborate
registers and discussing them statistically
with honest precision. But the first and
pressing point is to thoroughly justify any
crusade at all in favour of race improvement.
More is wanted in the way of unbiased
scientific inquiry along the many
roads I have hurried over, to make every
stepping-stone safe and secure, and to make it
certain that the game is really worth the candle.
All I dare hope to effect by this lecture is
to prove that in seeking for the improvement
of the race we aim at what is apparently
possible to accomplish, and that
we are justified in following every path in
a resolute and hopeful spirit that seems to
lead towards that end. The magnitude of
the inquiry is enormous, but its object is
one of the highest man can accomplish.
The faculties of future generations will
necessarily be distributed according to laws
of heredity, whose statistical effects are no
longer vague, for they are measured and
expressed in formulæ. We cannot doubt
the existence of a great power ready to
hand and capable of being directed with
vast benefit as soon as we shall have learnt
.bn p034.png
.pn +1
to understand and to apply it. To no
nation is a high human breed more necessary
than to our own, for we plant our stock all
over the world and lay the foundation of
the dispositions and capacities of future
millions of the human race.

EUGENICS: ITS DEFINITION, SCOPE AND AIMS.[#]

Eugenics is the science which deals with
all influences that improve the inborn qualities
of a race; also with those that develop them
to the utmost advantage. The improvement
of the inborn qualities, or stock, of some one
human population, will alone be discussed
here.

What is meant by improvement? What
by the syllable <em>Eu</em> in Eugenics, whose
English equivalent is <em>good</em>? There is considerable
difference between goodness in the
several qualities and in that of the character
as a whole. The character depends largely on
the <em>proportion</em> between qualities whose balance
may be much influenced by education. We
must therefore leave morals as far as possible
out of the discussion, not entangling ourselves
with the almost hopeless difficulties they raise
as to whether a character as a whole is good
or bad. Moreover, the goodness or badness
of character is not absolute, but relative to
the current form of civilisation. A fable will
best explain what is meant. Let the scene be
the Zoological Gardens in the quiet hours of
.bn p036.png
.pn +1
the night, and suppose that, as in old fables, the
animals are able to converse, and that some very
wise creature who had easy access to all the
cages, say a philosophic sparrow or rat, was
engaged in collecting the opinions of all sorts of
animals with a view of elaborating a system
of absolute morality. It is needless to enlarge
on the contrariety of ideals between the
beasts that prey and those they prey upon,
between those of the animals that have to
work hard for their food and the sedentary
parasites that cling to their bodies and suck
their blood, and so forth. A large number of
suffrages in favour of maternal affection
would be obtained, but most species of fish
would repudiate it, while among the voices of
birds would be heard the musical protest of
the cuckoo. Though no agreement could be
reached as to absolute morality, the essentials
of Eugenics may be easily defined. All
creatures would agree that it was better to be
healthy than sick, vigorous than weak, well
fitted than ill-fitted for their part in life. In
short that it was better to be good rather than
bad specimens of their kind, whatever that kind
might be. So with men. There are a vast
number of conflicting ideals of alternative
characters, of incompatible civilisations; but
all are wanted to give fulness and interest to
life. Society would be very dull if every man
resembled the highly estimable Marcus
Aurelius or Adam Bede. The aim of Eugenics
is to represent each class or sect by its best

specimens; that done, to leave them to work
out their common civilisation in their own way.

A considerable list of qualities can be easily
compiled that nearly every one except “cranks”
would take into account when picking out the
best specimens of his class. It would include
health, energy, ability, manliness and courteous
disposition. Recollect that the natural differences
between dogs are highly marked in all
these respects, and that men are quite as variable
by nature as other animals in their respective
species. Special aptitudes would be
assessed highly by those who possessed them,
as the artistic faculties by artists, fearlessness
of inquiry and veracity by scientists, religious
absorption by mystics, and so on. There
would be self-sacrificers, self-tormentors and
other exceptional idealists, but the representatives
of these would be better members of a
community than the body of their electors.
They would have more of those qualities that
are needed in a State, more vigour, more ability,
and more consistency of purpose. The community
might be trusted to refuse representatives
of criminals, and of others whom it rates
as undesirable.

Let us for a moment suppose that the
practice of Eugenics should hereafter raise
the average quality of our nation to that of its
better moiety at the present day and consider the
gain. The general tone of domestic, social
and political life would be higher. The race
as a whole would be less foolish, less frivolous,
.bn p038.png
.pn +1
less excitable and politically more provident
than now. Its demagogues who “played to
the gallery” would play to a more sensible
gallery than at present. We should be better
fitted to fulfil our vast imperial opportunities.
Lastly, men of an order of ability which is
now very rare, would become more frequent,
because the level out of which they rose
would itself have risen.

The aim of Eugenics is to bring as many
influences as can be reasonably employed, to
cause the useful classes in the community to
contribute <em>more</em> than their proportion to the
next generation.

The course of procedure that lies within
the functions of a learned and active Society
such as the Sociological may become, would
be somewhat as follows:--

1. Dissemination of a knowledge of the
laws of heredity so far as they are surely
known, and promotion of their farther study.
Few seem to be aware how greatly the knowledge
of what may be termed the <em>actuarial</em> side
of heredity has advanced in recent years.
The <em>average</em> closeness of kinship in each
degree now admits of exact definition and of
being treated mathematically, like birth and
death-rates, and the other topics with which
actuaries are concerned.

2. Historical inquiry into the rates with
which the various classes of society (classified
according to civic usefulness) have contributed
to the population at various times, in
.bn p039.png
.pn +1
ancient and modern nations. There is strong
reason for believing that national rise and
decline is closely connected with this influence.
It seems to be the tendency of high civilisation
to check fertility in the upper classes,
through numerous causes, some of which are
well known, others are inferred, and others
again are wholly obscure. The latter class
are apparently analogous to those which bar
the fertility of most species of wild animals in
zoological gardens. Out of the hundreds and
thousands of species that have been tamed,
very few indeed are fertile when their liberty
is restricted and their struggles for livelihood
are abolished; those which are so and are
otherwise useful to man becoming domesticated.
There is perhaps some connection between
this obscure action and the disappearance
of most savage races when brought into contact
with high civilization, though there are
other and well-known concomitant causes. But
while most barbarous races disappear, some,
like the negro, do not. It may therefore be
expected that types of our race will be found
to exist which can be highly civilised without
losing fertility; nay, they may become more
fertile under artificial conditions, as is the case
with many domestic animals.

3. Systematic collection of facts showing
the circumstances under which large and
thriving families have most frequently originated;
in other words, the <em>conditions</em> of
Eugenics. The names of the thriving families
.bn p040.png
.pn +1
in England have yet to be learnt, and the conditions
under which they have arisen. We
cannot hope to make much advance in the
science of Eugenics without a careful study of
facts that are now accessible with difficulty, if
at all. The definition of a thriving family,
such as will pass muster for the moment at
least is one in which the children have gained
distinctly superior positions to those who were
their class-mates in early life. Families may
be considered “large” that contain not less
than three adult male children. It would be
no great burden to a Society including many
members who had Eugenics at heart, to initiate
and to preserve a large collection of such records
for the use of statistical students. The
committee charged with the task would have to
consider very carefully the form of their circular
and the persons entrusted to distribute it.
The circular should be simple, and as
brief as possible, consistent with asking all
questions that are likely to be answered truly,
and which would be important to the inquiry.
They should ask, at least in the first instance,
only for as much information as could be
easily, and would be readily, supplied by any
member of the family appealed to. The point
to be ascertained is the <em>status</em> of the two
parents at the time of their marriage, whence
its more or less eugenic character might have
been predicted, if the larger knowledge that
we now hope to obtain had then existed.
Some account would, of course, be wanted of
.bn p041.png
.pn +1
their race, profession, and residence; also of
their own respective parentages, and of their
brothers and sisters. Finally, the reasons
would be required why the children deserved
to be entitled a “thriving” family, to distinguish
worthy from unworthy success.
This manuscript collection might hereafter
develop into a “golden book” of thriving
families. The Chinese, whose customs have
often much sound sense, make their honours
retrospective. We might learn from them to
show that respect to the parents of noteworthy
children, which the contributors of
such valuable assets to the national wealth
richly deserve. The act of systematically
collecting records of thriving families would
have the further advantage of familiarising
the public with the fact that Eugenics had at
length become a subject of serious scientific
study by an energetic Society.

4. Influences affecting Marriage. The
remarks of Lord Bacon in his essay on Death
may appropriately be quoted here. He says
with the view of minimising its terrors:

.in +4
.ll -4
.fs 85%
“There is no passion in the mind of men so weak
but it mates and masters the fear of death.\ -\ Revenge
triumphs over death; love slights it; honour aspireth to
it; grief flyeth to it; fear pre-occupateth it.”
.fs
.in
.ll

Exactly the same kind of considerations
apply to marriage. The passion of love seems so
overpowering that it may be thought folly to
try to direct its course. But plain facts do
not confirm this view. Social influences of
.bn p042.png
.pn +1
all kinds have immense power in the end, and
they are very various. If unsuitable marriages
from the Eugenic point of view were banned
socially, or even regarded with the unreasonable
disfavour which some attach to cousin-marriages,
very few would be made. The
multitude of marriage restrictions that have
proved prohibitive among uncivilised people
would require a volume to describe.

5. Persistence in setting forth the national
importance of Eugenics. There are three
stages to be passed through. <em>Firstly</em> it must
be made familiar as an academic question,
until its exact importance has been understood
and accepted as a fact; <em>Secondly</em> it must
be recognised as a subject whose practical
development deserves serious consideration;
and <em>Thirdly</em> it must be introduced into the
national conscience, like a new religion. It
has, indeed, strong claims to become an
orthodox religious tenet of the future, for
Eugenics co-operates with the workings of
Nature by securing that humanity shall be
represented by the fittest races. What
Nature does blindly, slowly, and ruthlessly,
man may do providently, quickly, and kindly.
As it lies within his power, so it becomes
his duty to work in that direction; just
as it is his duty to succour neighbours
who suffer misfortune. The improvement
of our stock seems to me one of the highest
objects that we can reasonably attempt. We
are ignorant of the ultimate destinies of
.bn p043.png
.pn +1
humanity, but feel perfectly sure that it is as
noble a work to raise its level in the sense
already explained, as it would be disgraceful
to abase it. I see no impossibility in Eugenics
becoming a religious dogma among mankind,
but its details must first be worked out
sedulously in the study. Over-zeal leading to
hasty action would do harm, by holding out
expectations of a near golden age, which will
certainly be falsified and cause the science to
be discredited. The first and main point is to
secure the general intellectual acceptance of
Eugenics as a hopeful and most important
study. Then let its principles work into the
heart of the nation, who will gradually give
practical effect to them in ways that we may
not wholly foresee.

RESTRICTIONS IN MARRIAGE.[#]

It is proposed in the following remarks to
meet an objection that has been repeatedly
urged against the possible adoption of any
system of Eugenics, namely, that human
nature would never brook interference with the
freedom of marriage.

In my reply, I shall proceed on the not
unreasonable assumption, that when the subject
of Eugenics shall be well understood, and
when its lofty objects shall have become
generally appreciated, they will meet with
some recognition both from the religious sense
of the people and from its laws. The question
now to be considered is, how far have marriage
restrictions proved effective, when sanctified
by the religion of the time, by custom, and by
law? I appeal from arm-chair criticism to
historical facts.

To this end, a brief history will be given
of a few widely spread customs. It will be
seen that with scant exceptions they are based
on social expediency, and not on natural instincts.
Each of the following paragraphs
might have been expanded into a long chapter
.bn p045.png
.pn +1
had that seemed necessary. Those who desire
to investigate the subject further can
easily do so by referring to standard works
in anthropology, among the most useful of
which, for the present purpose, are Frazer’s
<cite>Golden Bough</cite>, Westermarck’s <cite>History of
Marriage</cite>, Huth’s <cite>Marriage of Near Kin</cite>, and
Crawley’s <cite>Mystic Rose</cite>.

1. <sc>Monogamy.</sc> It is impossible to label
mankind by one general term, either as
animals who instinctively take a plurality of
mates, or who consort with only one, for history
suggests the one condition as often as the
other. Probably different races, like different
individuals, vary considerably in their natural
instincts. Polygamy may be understood
either as having a plurality of wives; or, as
having one principal wife and many secondary
but still legitimate wives, or any other recognised
but less legitimate connections; in
one or other of these forms it is now permitted—by
religion, customs, and law—to at least
one-half of the population of the world, though
its practice may be restricted to a few, on account
of cost, domestic peace, and the insufficiency
of females. Polygamy holds its
ground firmly throughout the Moslem world.
It exists throughout India and China in modified
forms, and it is entirely in accord with the
sentiments both of men and women in the
larger part of negro Africa. It was regarded
as a matter of course in the early Biblical days.
Jacob’s twelve children were born of four
.bn p046.png
.pn +1
mothers all living at the same time, namely,
Leah, and her sister Rachel, and their respective
handmaids Bilhah and Zilpah. Long
afterwards, the Jewish kings emulated the
luxurious habits of neighbouring potentates
and carried polygamy to an extreme degree.
For Solomon, see I Kings xi. 3. For his
son Rehoboam, see II Chron. xi. 21. The
history of the subsequent practice of the custom
among the Jews is obscure, but the Talmud
contains no law against polygamy. It must
have ceased in Judæa by the time of the
Christian Era. It was not then allowed
in either Greece or Rome. Polygamy
was unchecked by law in profligate Egypt,
but a reactionary and ascetic spirit existed,
and some celibate communities were formed
in the service of Isis, who seem to have
exercised a large though indirect influence in
introducing celibacy into the early Christian
Church. The restriction of marriage to one
living wife subsequently became the religion
and the law of all Christian nations, though
licence has been widely tolerated in royal and
other distinguished families, as in those of
some of our English kings. Polygamy was
openly introduced into Mormonism by
Brigham Young, who left seventeen wives,
and fifty-six children. He died in 1877;
polygamy was suppressed soon after (<cite>Encyc.
Brit.</cite>, xvi. 827.)

It is unnecessary for my present purpose
to go further into the voluminous data connected
.bn p047.png
.pn +1
with marriages such as these in all parts
of the world. Enough has been said to show
that the prohibition of polygamy, under
severe penalties by civil and ecclesiastical
law, has been due not to any natural instinct
against the practice, but to consideration of
social well-being. I conclude that equally
strict limitations to freedom of marriage
might, under the pressure of worthy motives,
be hereafter enacted for Eugenic and other
purposes.

2. <sc>Endogamy</sc>, or the custom of marrying
exclusively <em>within</em> one’s own tribe or caste,
has been sanctioned by religion and enforced
by law, in all parts of the world, but chiefly
in long settled nations where there is wealth
to bequeath and where neighbouring communities
profess different creeds. The
details of this custom, and the severity of its
enforcement, have everywhere varied from
century to century. It was penal for a Greek
to marry a barbarian, for a Roman patrician
to marry a plebeian, for a Hindu of one caste
to marry one of another caste, and so forth.
Similar restrictions have been enforced in
multitudes of communities, even under the
penalty of death.

A very typical instance of the power of
law over the freedom of choice in marriage,
and which was by no means confined to
Judæa, is that known as the Levirate. It
shows that family property and honour were
once held by the Jews to dominate over
.bn p048.png
.pn +1
individual preferences. The Mosaic law
actually <em>compelled</em> a man to marry the widow
of his brother if he left no male issue.
(Deuteron. xxv.) Should the brother refuse,
“then shall his brother’s wife come unto him
in the presence of the elders, and loose his
shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face;
and she shall answer and say, so shall it be
done unto the man that doth not build up his
brother’s house. And his name shall be called
in Israel the house of him that hath his shoe
loosed.” The form of this custom survives to
the present day and is fully described and
illustrated under the article “Halizah” (= taking
off, untying) in the <cite>Jewish Cyclopædia</cite>.
Jewish widows are now almost invariably remarried
with this ceremony. They are as we
might describe it, “given away” by a kinsman
of the deceased husband, who puts on a shoe of
an orthodox shape which is kept for the purpose,
the widow unties the shoe, spits, but now on
the <em>ground</em>, and repeats the specified words.

The duties attached to family property
led to the history, which is very strange to the
ideas of the present day, of Ruth’s advances
to Boaz under the advice of her mother.
“It came to pass at midnight” that Boaz
“was startled (see marginal note in the Revised
Version) and turned himself, and behold
a woman lay at his feet,” who had come
in “softly and uncovered his feet and laid her
down.” He told her to lie still until the early
morning and then to go away. She returned
.bn p049.png
.pn +1
home and told her mother, who said, “Sit
still, my daughter, until thou know how the
matter will fall, for the man will not rest until
he have finished the thing this day.” She
was right. Boaz took legal steps to disembarrass
himself of the claims of a still nearer
kinsman, “who drew off his shoe”; so Boaz
married Ruth. Nothing could be purer from
the point of view of those days, than the history
of Ruth. The feelings of the modern social
world would be shocked if the same thing
were to take place now in England.

Evidence from the various customs relating
to endogamy show how choice in marriage
may be dictated by religious custom.
That is, by a custom founded on a religious
view of family property and family
descent. Eugenics deal with what is more
valuable than money or lands, namely
the heritage of a high character, capable
brains, fine physique, and vigour; in short,
with all that is most desirable for a family to
possess as a birthright. It aims at the
evolution and preservation of high races of
men, and it as well deserves to be strictly
enforced as a religious duty, as the Levirate
law ever was.

3. <sc>Exogamy</sc> is, or has been, as widely
spread as the opposed rule of endogamy just
described. It is the duty enforced by custom,
religion, and law, of marrying <em>outside</em> one’s
own clan, and is usually in force amongst
small and barbarous communities. Its
.bn p050.png
.pn +1
former distribution is attested by the survival
in nearly all countries, of ceremonies based
on “marriage by capture.” The remarkable
monograph on this subject by the late Mr.
McLennan is of peculiar interest. It was
one of the earliest, and perhaps the most
successful, of all attempts to decipher prehistoric
customs by means of those now
existing among barbarians, and by the marks
they have left on the traditional practices of
civilised nations, including ourselves. Before
his time those customs were regarded as
foolish, and fitted only for antiquarian trifling.
In small fighting communities of barbarians,
daughters are a burden; they are usually
killed while infants, so few women are
found in a tribe who were born in it. It
may sometimes happen that the community
has been recently formed by warriors who
brought no women, and who, like the
Romans in the old story, could only supply
themselves by capturing those of neighbouring
tribes. The custom of capture grows;
it becomes glorified because each wife is a
living trophy of the captor’s heroism, and
marriage within the tribe soon comes to be
considered an unmanly, and at last a shameful
act. The modern instances of this among
barbarians are very numerous.

4. <sc>Australian Marriages.</sc> The following
is a brief clue, and apparently a true one,
to the complicated marriage restrictions
among Australian bushmen, which are enforced
.bn p051.png
.pn +1
by the penalty of death, and which seem to be
partly endogamous in origin and partly otherwise.
The example is typical of those of
many other tribes that differ in detail.

A and B are two tribal classes; 1 and 2
are two other and <em>independent</em> divisions of the
tribe (probably by totems). Any person, taken
at random, is equally likely to have either
letter or either numeral by birthright, and his
or her numeral and letter are well known to all
the community. Hence the members of the
tribe are sub-classed into four sub-divisions,
A1, A2, B1, B2. The rule is that a man
may marry those women only, whose letter and
numeral are both different to his own. Thus
A1 can marry only B2, the other three sub-divisions
A1, A2, and B1 being absolutely
barred to him. As to the children, there is a
difference of practice in different parts: in
the cases most often described, the child takes
its father’s letter and its mother’s numeral,
which determines class by paternal descent.
In other cases the arrangement runs in the
contrary way, that is by maternal descent.

The cogency of this rule is due to custom,
religion and law, and is so strong that
nearly all Australians would be horrified
at the idea of breaking it. If anyone dared to
do so, he would probably be clubbed to death.

Here then is another restriction to the
freedom of marriage which might with equal
propriety have been applied to the furtherance
of some form of Eugenics.
.bn p052.png
.pn +1

5. <sc>Taboo.</sc> The survival of young
animals largely depends on their inherent
timidity, their keen sensitiveness to warnings
of danger by their parents and others, and to
their tenacious recollection of them. It is so
with human children, who are easily terrified
by nurses’ tales and thereby receive more or
less durable impressions.

A vast complex of motives can be brought
to bear upon the naturally susceptible minds of
children, and of uneducated adults who are
mentally little more than big children. The
constituents of this complex are not sharply
distinguishable, but they form a recognisable
whole that has not yet received an appropriate
name, in which religion, superstition,
custom, tradition, law, and
authority all have part. This group of
motives will for the present purpose be
entitled “immaterial” in contrast to material
ones. My contention is that the experience
of all ages and all nations shows that the
immaterial motives are frequently far stronger
than the material ones, the relative power of
the two being well illustrated by the tyranny
of taboo in many instances, called as it is by
different names in different places. The facts
relating to taboo form a voluminous literature,
the full effect of which cannot be conveyed by
brief summaries. It shows how, in most parts of
the world, acts that are apparently insignificant,
have been invested with ideal importance,
and how the doing of this or that has been
.bn p053.png
.pn +1
followed by outlawry or death, and how the
mere terror of having unwittingly broken a
taboo, may suffice to kill the man who broke
it. If non-eugenic unions were prohibited by
such taboos, none would take place.

6. <sc>Prohibited Degrees.</sc> The institution
of marriage, as now sanctified by
religion and safeguarded by law in the more
highly civilised nations, may not be ideally
perfect, nor may it be universally accepted in
future times, but it is the best that has hitherto
been devised for the parties primarily
concerned, for their children, for home life,
and for society. The degrees of kinship
within which marriage is prohibited, is with
one exception quite in accordance with
modern sentiment, the exception being the
disallowal of marriage with the sister of a
deceased wife, the propriety of which is
greatly disputed and need not be discussed
here. The marriage of a brother and sister
would excite a feeling of loathing among us
that seems implanted by nature, but which
further inquiry will show, has mainly arisen
from tradition and custom.

We will begin by giving due weight to
certain assigned motives. (1) Indifference
and even repugnance between boys and girls,
irrespectively of relationship, who have been
reared in the same barbarian home. (2) Close
likeness, as between the members of a
thorough-bred stock, causes some sexual
indifference: thus highly bred dogs lose much
.bn p054.png
.pn +1
of their sexual desire for one another, and are
apt to consort with mongrels. (3) Contrast
is an element in sexual attraction which has
not yet been discussed quantitatively. Great
resemblance creates indifference, and great
dissimilarity is repugnant. The maximum of
attractiveness must lie somewhere between the
two, at a point not yet ascertained. (4) The
harm due to continued interbreeding has been
considered, as I think, without sufficient warrant,
to cause a presumed strong natural and
instinctive <em>repugnance</em> to the marriage of near
kin. The facts are that close and continued
interbreeding invariably does harm after a few
generations, but that a single cross with near
kinsfolk is practically innocuous. Of course
a sense of repugnance might become correlated
with any harmful practice, but there is no
evidence that it is <em>repugnance</em> with which interbreeding
is correlated, but only <em>indifference</em>;
this is equally effective in preventing it, but
is quite another thing. (5) The strongest
reason of all in civilised countries appears to
be the earnest desire not to infringe the
sanctity and freedom of the social relations of
a family group, but this has nothing to do
with instinctive sexual repugnance. Yet it is
through the latter motive alone, so far as I
can judge, that we have acquired our apparently
instinctive horror of marrying within
near degrees.

Next as to facts. History shows that
the horror now felt so strongly did not
.bn p055.png
.pn +1
exist in early times. Abraham married his
half-sister Sarah, “she is indeed the sister, the
daughter of my father, but not the daughter
of my mother, and she became my wife.”
(Gen. <sc>XX</sc>. 12). Amram, the father of Moses
and Aaron, married his aunt, his father’s
sister Jochabed. The Egyptians were accustomed
to marry sisters. It is unnecessary to
go earlier back in Egyptian history than to
Ptolemies, who, being a new dynasty, would
not have dared to make the marriages they
did in a conservative country, unless popular
opinion allowed it. Their dynasty includes
its founder Ceraunus, who is not numbered;
the numbering begins with his son Soter, and
goes on to Ptolemy XIII., the second husband
of Cleopatra. Leaving out her first husband,
Ptolemy XII., as he was a mere boy, and
taking in Ceraunus, there are thirteen
Ptolemies to be considered. Between them,
they contracted eleven incestuous marriages,
eight with whole sisters, one with a half-sister,
and two with nieces. Of course
the object was to keep the royal line pure, as
was done by the ancient Peruvians. It would
be tedious to follow out the laws enforced at
various times and in the various states of
Greece during the classical ages. Marriage
was at one time permitted in Athens between
half-brothers and half-sisters, and the
marriage between uncle and niece was
thought commendable in the time of Pericles,
when it was prompted by family considerations.
.bn p056.png
.pn +1
In Rome the practice varied much, but there
were always severe restrictions. Even in its
dissolute period, public opinion was shocked
by the marriage of Claudius with his niece.

A great deal more evidence could easily
be adduced, but the foregoing suffices to
prove that there is no instinctive repugnance
felt universally by man, to marriage within
the prohibited degrees, but that its present
strength is mainly due to what I call immaterial
considerations. It is quite conceivable that a
non-eugenic marriage should hereafter excite
no less loathing than that of a brother and
sister would do now.

7. <sc>Celibacy.</sc> The dictates of religion
in respect to the opposite duties of leading
celibate lives, and of continuing families, have
been contradictory. In many nations it is
and has been considered a disgrace to bear
no children, and in other nations celibacy has
been raised to the rank of a virtue of the
highest order. The ascetic character of the
African portion of the early Christian Church,
as already remarked, introduced the merits
of celibate life into its teaching. During the
fifty or so generations that have elapsed
since the establishment of Christianity, the
nunneries and monasteries, and the celibate
lives of Catholic priests, have had vast social
effects, how far for good and how far for evil
need not be discussed here. The point which
I wish to enforce is the potency, not only of
the religious sense in aiding or deterring
.bn p057.png
.pn +1
marriage, but more especially the influence
and authority of ministers of religion in enforcing
celibacy. They have notoriously used
it when aid has been invoked by members of
the family on grounds that are not religious at
all, but merely of family expediency. Thus,
at some times and in some Christian nations,
every girl who did not marry while still young,
was practically compelled to enter a nunnery
from which escape was afterwards impossible.

It is easy to let the imagination run
wild on the supposition of a whole-hearted
acceptance of Eugenics as a national religion;
that is of the thorough conviction by a nation
that no worthier object exists for man than
the improvement of his own race; and when
efforts as great as those by which nunneries
and monasteries were endowed and maintained
should be directed to fulfil an opposite purpose.
I will not enter further into this.
Suffice it to say, that the history of conventual
life affords abundant evidence on a very large
scale, of the power of religious authority in
directing and withstanding the tendencies of
human nature towards freedom in marriage.

<sc>Conclusion.</sc>—Seven different subjects
have now been touched upon. They are
monogamy, endogamy, exogamy, Australian
marriages, taboo, prohibited degrees and celibacy.
It has been shown under each of these
heads how powerful are the various combinations
of immaterial motives upon marriage
selection, how they may all become
.bn p058.png
.pn +1
hallowed by religion, accepted as custom and
enforced by law. Persons who are born under
their various rules live under them without
any objection. They are unconscious of their
restrictions, as we are unaware of the tension
of the atmosphere. The subservience of
civilised races to their several religious superstitions,
customs, authority, and the rest, is
frequently as abject as that of barbarians.
The same classes of motives that direct other
races, direct ours, so a knowledge of their
customs helps us to realise the wide range of
what we may ourselves hereafter adopt, for
reasons that will be as satisfactory to us in
those future times, as theirs are or were to
them, at the time when they prevailed.

Reference has frequently been made to
the probability of Eugenics hereafter receiving
the sanction of religion. It may be asked,
“how can it be shown that Eugenics fall
within the purview of our own.” It cannot,
any more than the duty of making provision
for the future needs of oneself and
family, which is a cardinal feature of
modern civilization, can be deduced from
the Sermon on the Mount. Religious precepts,
founded on the ethics and practice of olden
days, require to be reinterpreted to make
them conform to the needs of progressive
nations. Ours are already so far behind
modern requirements that much of our
practice and our profession cannot be reconciled
without illegitimate casuistry. It seems
.bn p059.png
.pn +1
to me that few things are more needed by us
in England than a revision of our religion, to
adapt it to the intelligence and needs of the
present time. A form of it is wanted that
shall be founded on reasonable bases and
enforced by reasonable hopes and fears, and
that preaches honest morals in unambiguous
language, which good men who take their
part in the work of the world, and who know
the dangers of sentimentalism, may pursue
without reservation.

STUDIES IN NATIONAL EUGENICS[#]

It was stated in the <cite>Times</cite>, January, 26,
1905, that at a meeting of the Senate of the
University of London, Mr. Edgar Schuster,
M.A., of New College, Oxford, was appointed
to the Francis Galton Research Fellowship
in National Eugenics. “Mr. Schuster will in
particular carry out investigations into the
history of classes and families, and deliver
lectures and publish memoirs on the subjects of
his investigations.”

Now that this appointment has been
made, it seems well to publish a suitable
list of subjects for eugenic inquiry. It will be
a programme that binds no one, not even
myself, for I have not yet had the advantage
of discussing it with others, and may hereafter
wish to largely revise and improve what is now
provisionally sketched. The use of this paper
lies in its giving a general outline of what,
according to my present view, requires careful
investigation, of course not all at once, but
step by step, at possibly long intervals.

I. Estimation of the average quality of\
the offspring of married couples, from\
their personal and ancestral data. This includes\
questions of fertility, and the determination\
of the “probable error” of the\
estimate for individuals, according to the data\
employed.

(<i>a</i>) “Biographical Index to Gifted Families,”
modern and recent, for publication. It might be drawn
up on the same principle as my “Index to Achievements
of Near Kinsfolk of some of the Fellows of the
Royal Society” (see “Sociological Papers,” Vol. I., p.
85). The Index refers only to facts creditable to the
family, and to such of these as have already appeared in
publications, which are quoted as authority for the
statements. Other biographical facts that may be
collected concerning these families are to be preserved
for statistical use only.

(<i>b</i>) Biographies of capable families, who do not
rank as “gifted,” are to be collected, and kept in MS.,
for statistical use, but with option of publication.

(<i>c</i>) Biographies of families, who, as a whole, are
distinctly below the average in health, mind, or physique,
are to be collected. These include the families of
persons in asylums of all kinds, hospitals, and prisons.
To be kept for statistical use only.

(<i>d</i>) Parentage and progeny of representatives of
each of the social classes of the community, to determine
how far each class is derived from, and contributes to,
its own and other classes. This inquiry must be carefully
planned beforehand.

(<i>e</i>) Insurance Office data. An attempt to be made
to carry out the suggestions of Mr. Palin Egerton,
“Sociological Papers,” Vol. I., p. 62, of obtaining
material that the authorities would not object to give,
and whose discussion might be advantageous to themselves
as well as to Eugenics. The matter is now under
consideration, so more cannot be said.

II. Effects of action by the State and\
by Public Institutions.

(<i>f</i>) Habitual criminals. Public opinion is beginning
to regard with favour the project of a prolonged segregation
of habitual criminals, for the purpose of
restricting their opportunities for (1) continuing their
depredations, and (2) producing low class offspring.
The enquiries spoken of above (see <i>c</i>) will measure the
importance of the latter object.

(<i>g</i>) Feeble minded. Aid given to Institutions for
the feeble minded are open to the suspicions that they
may eventually promote their marriage and the production
of offspring like themselves. Inquiries are
needed to test the truth of this suspicion.

(<i>h</i>) Grants towards higher education. Money
spent in the higher education of those who are intellectually
unable to profit by it lessens the sum available for
those who can do so. It might be expected that aid
systematically given on a large scale to the more capable
would have considerable eugenic effect, but the subject
is complex and needs investigation.

(<i>i</i>) Indiscriminate charity, including out-door relief.
There is good reason to believe that the effects of
indiscriminate charity are notably non-eugenic. This
topic affords a wide field for inquiry.

III. Other influences that further or\
restrain particular classes of marriage.

The instances are numerous in recent times in
which social influences have restrained or furthered
freedom of marriage. A judicious selection of these
would be useful, and might be undertaken as time admits.
I have myself just communicated to the Sociological
Society a memoir entitled “Restrictions in
Marriage,” in which remarkable instances are given of
the dominant power of religion, law and custom. This
will suggest the sort of work now in view, where less
powerful influences have produced statistical effects of
appreciable amount.

IV. Heredity.

The facts after being collected are to be discussed,
for improving our knowledge of the laws both actuarial
and of physiological heredity, the recent methods of advanced
statistics being of course used. It is possible
that a study of the effect on the offspring of differences
in the parental qualities may prove important.

It is to be considered whether a study of Eurasians,
that is, of the descendants of Hindoo and English parents,
might not be advocated in proper quarters, both on its
own merits as a topic of national importance and as a
test of the applicability of the Mendelian hypotheses to
men. Eurasians have by this time intermarried during
three consecutive generations in sufficient numbers to
yield trustworthy results.

.sp 2

.h3 nobreak align=l
V. Literature.

A vast amount of material that bears on Eugenics
exists in print, much of which is valuable and should be
hunted out and catalogued. Many scientific societies,
medical, actuarial, and others, publish such material
from time to time. The experiences of breeders of stock
of all kinds, and those of horticulturists, fall within this
category.

.sp 2

.h3 nobreak align=l
VI. Co-operation.

After good work shall have been done and become
widely recognised, the influence of eugenic students in
stimulating others to contribute to their inquiries may
become powerful. It is too soon to speculate on this,
but every good opportunity should be seized to further
co-operation, as well as the knowledge and application of
Eugenics.

.sp 2

.h3 nobreak align=l
VII. Certificates.

In some future time, dependent on circumstances,
I look forward to a suitable authority issuing Eugenic
certificates to candidates for them. They would imply a
more than an average share of the several qualities of at
least goodness of constitution, of physique, and of
mental capacity. Examinations upon which such certificates
.bn p064.png
.pn +1
might be granted are already carried on, but
separately; some by the medical advisers of
insurance offices, some by medical men as to
physical fitness for the army, navy and Indian
services, and others in the ordinary scholastic
examinations. Supposing constitution, physique and
intellect to be three independent variables (which they
are not), the men who rank among the upper third of
each group would form only one twenty-seventh part of
the population. Even allowing largely for the correlation
of those qualities, it follows that a moderate severity of
selection in each of a few particulars would lead to a
severe all-round selection. It is not necessary to pursue
this further.

.tb

The above brief memorandum does not
profess to deal with more than the pressing
problems in Eugenics. As that science becomes
better known, and the bases on which
it rests are more soundly established, new
problems will arise, especially such as relate
to its practical application. All this must bide
its time; there is no good reason to anticipate
it now. Of course useful suggestions in the
present embryonic condition of Eugenic study
would be timely, and might prove very helpful
to students.

<sc>Mr. Galton’s Reply to remarks made during the discussion that followed.</sc>

This Society has cause to congratulate
itself on the zeal and energy which has
brought together so large a body of opinion.
We have had verbal contributions from
four eminent specialists in anthropology:
Dr. Haddon, Dr. Mott, Mr. Crawley, and
.bn p065.png
.pn +1
Dr. Westermarck, and numerous written
communications have been furnished by
well known persons. At the time that I am
revising and extending these words no less
than twenty-six contributions to the discussion
are in print. Want of space compels me to
confine my reply to those remarks that seem
more especially to require it, and to do so
very briefly, for Eugenics is a wide study,
with an uncounted number of side issues
into which those who discuss it are tempted
to stray. If, however, sure advance is to
be made, these issues must be thoroughly
explored, one by one, and partial discussion
should as far as possible be avoided. To
change the simile, we have to deal with a
formidable chain of strongholds, which must
be severally attacked in force, reduced, and
disposed of, before we can proceed freely.

In the first place, it is a satisfaction to
find that no one impugns the conclusion
which my memoir was written to justify,
that history tells how restrictions in marriage,
even of an excessive kind, have been contentedly
accepted very widely, under the
guidance of what I called “immaterial
motives.” This is all I had in view when
writing it.

<i>Certificates.</i>—One of the comments on which I will
remark is that if certificates were now offered to those
who passed certain examinations into health, physique,
moral and intellectual powers, and hereditary gifts,
great mistakes would be made by the examiners. I
fully agree that it is too early to devise a satisfactory
.bn p066.png
.pn +1
system of marks for giving what might be styled
“honour-certificates,” because we do not yet possess
sufficient data to go upon. On the other hand there are
persons who are exceptionally and unquestionably unfit
to contribute offspring to the nation, such as those
mentioned in Dr. Mott’s bold proposals. The best
methods of dealing with these are now ripe for immediate
consideration.

<i>Breeding for points.</i>—It is objected by many that there
cannot be unanimity on the “points” that it is most
desirable to breed for. I fully discussed this objection
in my memoir read here last spring, showing that some
qualities such as health and vigour were thought by all
to be desirable, and the opposite undesirable, and that
this sufficed to give a first direction to our aims. It is a
safe starting point, though a great deal more has to be
inquired into as we proceed on our way. I think that
some contributors to this discussion have been needlessly
alarmed. No question has been raised by me of breeding
men like animals for particular points, to the
disregard of all-round efficiency in physical, intellectual
(including moral), and hereditary qualifications. Moreover,
as statistics have shown, the best qualities are
largely correlated. The youths who became judges,
bishops, statesmen, and leaders of progress in England
could have furnished formidable athletic teams in their
times. There is a tale, I know not how far founded on
fact, that Queen Elizabeth had an eye to the calves of
the legs of those she selected for bishops. There is
something to be said in favour of selecting men by their
physical characteristics for other than physical purposes.
It would decidedly be safer to do so than to trust to
pure chance.

<i>The residue.</i>—It is also objected that if the inferior
moiety of a race are left to intermarry, their produce
will be increasingly inferior. This is certainly an error.
The law of “regression towards mediocrity” insures
that their offspring as a whole, will be superior to themselves,
and if as I sincerely hope, a freer action will be
hereafter allowed to selective agencies than hitherto, the
.bn p067.png
.pn +1
portion of the offspring so selected would be better still.
The influences that now <em>withstand</em> the free action of
selective agencies are numerous, they include indiscriminate
charity.

<i>Passion of love.</i>—The argument has been repeated that
love is too strong a passion to be restrained by such
means as would be tolerated at the present time. I
regret that I did not express the distinction that ought
to have been made between its two stages, that of
slight inclination and that of falling thoroughly into
love, for it is the first of these rather than the second
that I hope the popular feeling of the future will successfully
resist. Every match-making mother appreciates
the difference. If a girl is taught to look upon a class of
men as tabooed, whether owing to rank, creed, connections,
or other causes, she does not regard them as
possible husbands and turns her thoughts elsewhere.
The proverbial “Mrs. Grundy” has enormous influence
in checking the marriages she considers indiscreet.

<i>Eugenics as a factor in religion.</i>—Remarks have been
made concerning eugenics as a religion; this will be the
subject of the brief memoir that follows these remarks.
.fs

It is much to be desired that competent
persons would severally take up one or other
of the many topics mentioned in my second
memoir, or others of a similar kind, and work
it thoroughly out as they would any ordinary
scientific problem; in this way solid progress
would be made. I must be allowed to re-emphasise
my opinion that an immense
amount of investigation has to be accomplished
before a definite system of
Eugenics can be safely framed.

.h2
EUGENICS AS A FACTOR IN RELIGION.

Eugenics strengthens the sense of social
duty in so many important particulars that
the conclusions derived from its study ought
to find a welcome home in every tolerant
religion. It promotes a far-sighted philanthropy,
the acceptance of parentage as a serious
responsibility, and a higher conception of
patriotism. The creed of eugenics is founded
upon the idea of evolution; not on a passive
form of it, but on one that can to some extent
direct its own course. Purely passive, or
what may be styled mechanical evolution,
displays the awe inspiring spectacle of a vast
eddy of organic turmoil, originating we know
not how, and travelling we know not whither.
It forms a continuous whole from first to last,
reaching backward beyond our earliest knowledge
and stretching forward as far as we think
we can foresee. But it is moulded by blind
and wasteful processes, namely, by an extravagant
production of raw material and the
ruthless rejection of all that is superfluous,
through the blundering steps of trial and error.
The condition at each successive moment of
this huge system, as it issues from the already
quiet past and is about to invade the still undisturbed
future, is one of violent internal
commotion. Its elements are in constant
.bn p069.png
.pn +1
flux and change, though its general form
alters but slowly. In this respect it resembles
the curious stream of cloud that
sometimes seems attached to a mountain top
during the continuance of a strong breeze;
its constituents are always changing, though its
shape as a whole hardly varies. Evolution
is in any case a grand phantasmagoria, but it
assumes an infinitely more interesting aspect
under the knowledge that the intelligent
action of the human will is, in some small
measure, capable of guiding its course. Man
has the power of doing this largely so far as
the evolution of humanity is concerned; he
has already affected the quality and distribution
of organic life so widely that the
changes on the surface of the earth, merely
through his disforestings and agriculture,
would be recognisable from a distance as
great as that of the moon.

.tb

As regards the practical side of eugenics,
we need not linger to re-open the unending
argument whether man possesses any creative
power of will at all, or whether his will is not
also predetermined by blind forces or by
intelligent agencies behind the veil, and
whether the belief that man can act independently
is more than a mere illusion. This
matters little in practice, because men,
whether fatalists or not, work with equal
vigour whenever they perceive they have the
power to act effectively.
.bn p070.png
.pn +1

Eugenic belief extends the function of
philanthropy to future generations, it renders
its action more pervading than hitherto, by
dealing with families and societies in their
entirety, and it enforces the importance of
the marriage covenant by directing serious
attention to the probable quality of the
future offspring. It sternly forbids all forms
of sentimental charity that are harmful to
the race, while it eagerly seeks opportunity
for acts of personal kindness, as some
equivalent to the loss of what it forbids.
It brings the tie of kinship into prominence
and strongly encourages love and interest
in family and race. In brief, eugenics is a
virile creed, full of hopefulness, and appealing
to many of the noblest feelings of our
nature.

PROBABILITY, THE FOUNDATION OF EUGENICS.[#]

The request so honourable to myself, to
be the Herbert Spencer lecturer of this
year, aroused a multitude of vivid recollections.
Spencer’s strong personality, his
complete devotion to a self-imposed and
life-long task, together with rare gleams of
tenderness visible amidst a wilderness of
abstract thought, have left a unique impression
on my mind that years fail to weaken.

I do not propose to speak of his writings;
they have been fully commented on elsewhere,
but I desire to acknowledge my
personal debt to him, which is large. It
lies in what I gained through his readiness to
discuss any ideas I happened to be full of at
the time, with quick sympathy and keen
criticism. It was his custom for many afternoons
to spend an hour or two of rest in the
old smoking room of the Athenaeum Club,
strolling into an adjoining compartment for a
game of billiards when the table was free.
Day after day on those afternoons I enjoyed
brief talks with him, which were often of
.bn p074.png
.pn +1
exceptional interest to myself. All that kind
of comfort and pleasure has long ago passed
from me. Among the many things of which
age deprives us, I regret few more than the
loss of contemporaries. When I was young
I felt diffident in the presence of my seniors,
partly owing to a sense that the ideas of the
young cannot be in complete sympathy with
those of the old. Now that I myself am old
it seems to me that my much younger friends
keenly perceive the same difference, and I
lose much of that outspoken criticism which
is an invaluable help to all who investigate.

<sc>History of Eugenics.</sc>

It must have surprised you as it did myself
to find the new word ‘Eugenics’ in the
title both of the Boyle Lecture, delivered in
Oxford about a fortnight ago, and of this. It
was an accident, not a deliberate concurrence,
and I accept it as a happy omen. The field
of Eugenics is so wide that there is no need
for myself, the second lecturer, to plant my
feet in the footsteps of the first; on the contrary,
it gives freedom by absolving me from
saying much that had to be said in one way
or another. I fully concur in the views so
ably presented by my friend and co-adjutor,
Professor Karl Pearson, and am glad to be
dispensed from further allusion to subjects
that formed a large portion of his lecture, on
which he is a far better guide and an infinitely
higher authority than myself.
.bn p075.png
.pn +1

In giving the following sketch of the history
of Eugenics I am obliged to be egotistical,
because I kindled the feeble flame that
struggled doubtfully for a time until it caught
hold of adjacent stores of suitable material,
and became a brisk fire, burning freely by itself,
and again because I have had much to
do with its progress quite recently.

The word ‘Eugenics’ was coined and used
by me in my book <cite>Human Faculty</cite>, published
as long ago as 1883, which has long been out
of print; it is, however, soon to be re-published
in a cheap form.[#] In it I emphasized the
essential brotherhood of mankind, heredity
being to my mind a very real thing; also the
belief that we are born to act, and not to wait
for help like able-bodied idlers, whining for
doles. Individuals appear to me as finite
detachments from an infinite ocean of being,
temporarily endowed with executive powers.
This is the only answer I can give to myself
in reply to the perpetually recurring questions
of ‘Why? whence? and whither?’ The immediate
‘whither?’ does not seem wholly dark,
as some little information may be gleaned
concerning the direction in which Nature, so
far as we know of it, is now moving—Namely,
towards the evolution of mind, body, and character
in increasing energy and co-adaptation.

I have often wondered that the poem of
Hyperion, by Keats—that magnificent torso
of an incompleted work—has not been placed
.bn p076.png
.pn +1
in the very forefront of past speculations on
evolution. Keats is so thorough that he
makes the very Divinities to be its product.
The earliest gods such as Coelus, born out of
Chaos, are vague entities, they engender
Saturn, Oceanus, Hyperion, and the Titan
brood, who supersede them. These in their
turn are ousted from dominion by their own
issue, the Olympian Gods. A notable advance
occurs at each successive stage in the quality
of the Divinities. When Hyperion, newly
terrified by signs of impending overthrow, lies
prostrate on the earth ‘his ancient mother, for
some comfort yet,’ the voice of Coelus from
the universal space, thus ‘whispered low and
solemn in his ear ... yet do thou strive, for
thou art capable ... my life is but the life
of winds and tides, no more than winds and
tides can I prevail, but thou canst.’ I have
quoted only disjointed fragments of this
wonderful poem, enough to serve as a
reminder to those who know it, but will add
ten consecutive lines from the speech of the
fallen Oceanus to his comrades, which give
a summary of evolution as here described:

As Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far
Than Chaos and black Darkness, though once chiefs,
And as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth
In form and shape compact and beautiful,
In Will, in action free, companionship,
And thousand other signs of purer life;
So on our heels a fresh perfection treads
A power more strong in beauty, born of us
And fated to excel us, as we pass
In glory that old Darkness.

He ends with ‘this is the truth, and let it
be your balm.’ The poem is a noble conception,
founded on the crude cosmogony of the
ancient Greeks.

The ideas have long held my fancy that
we men may be the chief, and perhaps the
only executives on earth. That we are detached
on active service with, it may be only
illusory, powers of free-will. Also that we
are in some way accountable for our success
or failure to further certain obscure ends, to
be guessed as best we can. That though our
instructions are obscure they are sufficiently
clear to justify our interference with the
pitiless course of Nature, whenever it seems
possible to attain the goal towards which it
moves, by gentler and kindlier ways. I expressed
these views as forcibly as I then could
in the above-mentioned book, with especial
reference to improving the racial qualities of
mankind, where the truest piety seems to
me to reside in taking action, and not in
submissive acquiescence to the routine of
Nature. It was thought impious at one time
to attach lightning conductors to churches,
as showing a want of trust in the tutelary care
of the Deity to whom they were dedicated; now
I think most persons would be inclined to apply
some contemptuous epithet to such as obstinately
refused, on those grounds, to erect them.

The direct pursuit of studies in Eugenics,
as to what could practically be done, and the
amount of change in racial qualities that
.bn p078.png
.pn +1
could reasonably be anticipated, did not at
first attract investigators. The idea of effecting
an improvement in that direction was too
much in advance of the march of popular
imagination, so I had to wait. In the meantime
I occupied myself with collateral problems,
more especially with that of dealing
measurably with faculties that are variously
distributed in a large population. The results
were published in my ‘Natural Inheritance’
in 1889, and I shall have occasion to utilize
some of them later on, in this very lecture.
The publication of that book proved to be
more timely than the former. The methods
were greatly elaborated by Professor Karl
Pearson, and applied by him to Biometry.
Professor Weldon, of this University, whose
untimely death is widely deplored, aided
powerfully. A new science was thus created
primarily on behalf of Biometry, but equally
applicable to Eugenics, because their provinces
overlap.

The publication of <cite>Biometrika</cite>, in which
I took little more than a nominal part,
appeared in 1901.

Being myself appointed Huxley Lecturer
before the Anthropological Institute in 1901 I
took for my title ‘The possible improvement
of the Human Breed under the existing
conditions of Law and Sentiment’ (<cite>Nature</cite>,
November 1, 1901, <cite>Report of the Smithsonian
Institute, Washington</cite>, for the same year, and
reprinted in this volume.)

The next and a very important step
towards Eugenics was made by Professor
Karl Pearson in his Huxley Lecture of 1903
entitled ‘The Laws of Inheritance in Man’
(<cite>Biometrika</cite>, vol. iii). It contains a most
valuable compendium of work achieved and
of objects in view; also the following passage
(p. 159), which is preceded by forcible reasons
for his conclusions:

We are ceasing as a nation to breed intelligence as
we did fifty to a hundred years ago. The mentally
better stock in the nation is not reproducing itself at the
same rate as it did of old; the less able and the less
energetic are more fertile than the better stocks. No
scheme of wider or more thorough education will bring
up, in the scale of intelligence, hereditary weakness to
the level of hereditary strength. The only remedy, if
one be possible at all, is to alter the relative fertility of
the good and the bad stocks in the community.

Again in 1904, having been asked by the
newly-formed Sociological Society to contribute
a memoir, I did so on ‘Eugenics, its
definition, aim and scope.’ This was followed
up in 1905 by three memoirs, ‘Restrictions
in Marriage,’ ‘Studies in National Eugenics,’
and ‘Eugenics as a factor in Religion,’ which
were published in the Memoirs of that Society
with comments thereon by more than
twenty different authorities (<cite>Sociological
Papers</cite>, published for the Sociological Society
(Macmillan), vols. i and ii. These are re-published
here). The subject of Eugenics
being thus formally launched, and the time
.bn p080.png
.pn +1
appearing ripe, I offered a small endowment
to the University of London, to found
a Research Fellowship on its behalf. The
offer was cordially accepted, so Eugenics
gained the recognition of its importance by
the University of London and a home for
its study in University College. Mr. Edgar
Schuster, of this University, became Research
Fellow in 1905, and I am much indebted to
his care in nurturing the young undertaking
and for the memoirs he has contributed, part
of which must still remain for a short time
unpublished.

When the date for Mr. Schuster’s retirement
approached it was advisable to utilize
the experience so far gained in reorganizing
the Office. Professor Pearson and myself, in
consultation with the authorities of the University
of London, elaborated a scheme at
the beginning of this year, which is a decided
advance, and shows every sign of vitality and
endurance. Mr. David Heron, a Mathematical
Scholar of St. Andrew’s, is now a
Research Fellow; Miss Ethel Elderton, who
has done excellent and expert work from the
beginning, is deservedly raised to the position
of Research Scholar; and the partial services
of a trained Computer have been secured. An
event of the highest importance to the future
of the Office is that Professor Karl Pearson
has undertaken, at my urgent request, that
general supervision of its work which advancing
age and infirmities preclude me from
.bn p081.png
.pn +1
giving. He will, I trust, treat it much as an
<em>annexe</em> to his adjacent biometric laboratory,
for many studies in Eugenics might, with
equal propriety, be carried on in either of them,
and the same methods of precise analysis
which are due to the mathematical skill and
untiring energy of Professor Pearson are used
in both. The Office now bears the name of
the Eugenics Laboratory, and its temporary
home is in 88 Gower Street. (It is now, 1909,
housed in the University buildings.) The
phrase ‘National Eugenics’ is defined as ‘the
study of agencies under social control that
may improve or impair the racial qualities of
future generations, either physically or
mentally.’

The Laboratory has already begun to
publish memoirs on its own account, and I
now rest satisfied in the belief that, with a
fair share of good luck, this young Institution
will prosper and grow into an important centre
of research.

<sc>Application of Theories of Probability to Eugenics.</sc>

Eugenics seeks for quantitative results. It
is not contented with such vague words as
‘much’ or ‘little,’ but endeavours to determine
‘how much’ or ‘how little’ in precise
and trustworthy figures. A simple example
will show the importance of this. Let us
suppose a class of persons, called <i>A</i>, who are
afflicted with some form and some specified
.bn p082.png
.pn +1
degree of degeneracy, as inferred from personal
observations, and from family history,
and let class <i>B</i> consist of the offspring of <i>A</i>.
We already know only too well that when the
grade of <i>A</i> is very low, that of the average <i>B</i>
will be below par and mischievous to the community,
but how mischievous will it probably
be? This question is of a familiar kind,
easily to be answered when a sufficiency of
facts have been collected. But a second
question arises. What will be the trustworthiness
of the forecast derived from averages
when it is applied to individuals? This is a
kind of question that is not familiar, and
rarely taken into account, although it too
could be answered easily as follows. The
average mischief done by each <i>B</i> individual to
the community may for brevity be called <i>M</i>:
the mischiefs done by the several individuals
differ more or less from <i>M</i> by amounts whose
average may be called <i>D</i>. In other words <i>D</i>
is the average amount of the individual deviations
from <i>M</i>. <i>D</i> thus becomes the measure
of untrustworthiness. The smaller <i>D</i> is, the
more precise the forecast, and the stronger
the justification for taking such drastic
measures against the propagation of class <i>B</i>
as would be consonant to the feelings if the
forecast were known to be infallible. On the
other hand, a large <i>D</i> signifies a corresponding
degree of uncertainty, and a risk that might
be faced without reproach through a sentiment
akin to that expressed in the maxim ‘It
.bn p083.png
.pn +1
is better that many guilty should escape than
that one innocent person should suffer.’ But
that is not the sentiment by which natural
selection is guided, and it is dangerous to
yield far to it.

There can be no doubt that a thorough
investigation of the kind described, even if
confined to a single grade and to a single form
of degeneracy, would be a serious undertaking.
Masses of trustworthy material must be collected,
usually with great difficulty, and be
afterwards treated with skill and labour by
methods that few at present are competent to
employ. An extended investigation into the
good or evil done to the State by the offspring
of many different classes of persons, some of
civic value, others the reverse, implies a huge
volume of work sufficient to occupy Eugenics
laboratories for an indefinite time.

<sc>Object Lessons in the Methods of Biometry.</sc>

I propose now to speak of those fundamental
principles of the laws of Probability
that are chiefly concerned in the newer
methods of Biometry, and consequently of
Eugenics. Most persons of ordinary education
seem to know nothing about them, not
even understanding their technical terms,
much less appreciating the cogency of their
results. This popular ignorance so obstructs
the path of Eugenics that I venture to tax
your attention by proposing a method of
.bn p084.png
.pn +1
partly dispelling it. Let me first say that no
one can be more conscious than myself of the
large amount of study that is required to
qualify a man to deal adequately with the
mathematical methods of Biometry, or that
any man can hope for much success in that
direction unless he is possessed of appropriate
faculties and a strong brain. On the other
hand, I hold an opinion likely at first sight to
scandalize biometricians and which I must
justify, that the fundamental ideas on which
abstruse problems of Probability are based
admit of being so presented to any intelligent
person as to be grasped by him, even though
he be quite ignorant of mathematics. The
conditions of doing so are that the lessons
shall be as far as possible ‘Object lessons,’ in
which real objects shall be handled as in the
Kindergarten system, and simple operations
performed and not only talked about. I am
anxious to make myself so far understood,
that some teachers of science may be induced
to elaborate the course that I present now
only in outline. It seems to me suitably
divisible into a course of five lessons of one
hour each, which would be sufficient to introduce
the learner into a new world of ideas,
extraordinarily wide in their application. A
proper notion of what is meant by Correlation
requires some knowledge of the principal
features of Variation, and will be the goal towards
which the lessons lead.

To most persons Variability implies something
.bn p085.png
.pn +1
indefinite and capricious. They require
to be taught that it, like Proteus in the old fable,
can be seized, securely bound, and utilized;
that it can be defined and measured. It was
disregarded by the old methods of statistics,
that concerned themselves solely with Averages.
The average amount of various
measurable faculties or events in a multitude
of persons was determined by simple methods,
the individual variations being left out of
account as too difficult to deal with. A population
was treated by the old methods as a
structureless atom, but the newer methods
treat it as a compound unit. It will be a considerable
intellectual gain to an otherwise
educated person, to fully understand the way
in which this can be done, and this and such
like matters the proposed course of lessons
is intended to make clear. It cannot be
expected that in the few available minutes
more than an outline can be given here of
what is intended to be conveyed in perhaps
thirty-fold as much time with the aid of profuse
illustrations by objects and diagrams. At
the risk of being wearisome, it is, however,
necessary to offer the following syllabus of
what is proposed, for an outline of what
teachers might fill in.

The object of the first lesson would be to
explain and illustrate Variability of Size,
Weight, Number, &c., by exhibiting samples
of specimens that have been marshalled at
random (Fig. 1), or arrayed in order of their
.bn p086.png
.pn +1
magnitude (Fig. 2). Thus when variations of
length were considered, objects of suitable
size, such as chestnuts, acorns, hazel-nuts,
stones of wall fruit, might be arrayed as
beads on a string. It will be shown that an
‘Array’ of Variates of any kind falls into a
continuous series. That each variate differs
little from its neighbours about the middles of
the Arrays, but that such differences increase
rapidly towards their extremities. Abundant
illustration would be required, and much
handling of specimens.

Arrays of Variates of the same class strung
together, differing considerably in the number
of the objects they each contain, would be
laid side by side and their middlemost
variates or ‘Medians’ (Fig. 3) would be
compared. It would be shown that as a rule
the Medians become very similar to one
another when the numbers in the Arrays are
large. It must then be dogmatically explained
that double accuracy usually accompanies a
four-fold number, treble accuracy a nine-fold
number, and so on.

(This concludes the first lesson, during
which the words and significations of Variability,
Variate, Array, and Median will have
been learnt.)

The second lesson is intended to give more
precision to the idea of an Array. The
variates in any one of these strung loosely on
a cord, should be disposed at equal distances
apart in front of an equal number of compartments,
.bn p087.png
.pn +1
like horses in the front of a row of
stalls (Fig. 4), and their tops joined. There
will be one more side to the row of stalls than
there are horses, otherwise a side of one of
the extreme stalls would be wanting. Thus
there are two ways of indicating the position
of a particular variate, either by its <em>serial
number</em> as ‘first,’ ‘second,’ ‘third,’ or so on,
or by <em>degrees</em> like those of a thermometer.
In the latter case the sides of the stalls serve
as degrees, counting the first of them as 0°,
making one more graduation than the number
of objects, as it should be. The difference
between these two methods has to be made
clear, and that while the serial position of the
Median object is always the same in any two
Arrays whatever be the number of variates,
the serial position of their subdivisions cannot
be the same, the ignored half interval at
either end varying in width according to the
number of variates, and becoming considerable
when that number is small.

Lines of proportionate length will then be
drawn on a blackboard, and the limits of the
Array will be also drawn, at a half interval
from either of its ends. The base is then to
be divided centesimally.

Next join the tops of the lines with a
smooth curve, and wipe out everything except
the curve, the Limit at either side, and the
Centesimally divided Base (Fig. 5). This
figure forms a Scheme of Distribution of
Variates. Explain clearly that its shape is
.bn p088.png
.pn +1
independent of the number of Variates, so
long as they are sufficiently numerous to
secure statistical constancy.

Show numerous schemes of variates of
different kinds, and remark on the prevalent
family likeness between the bounding curves.
(Words and meanings learnt—Schemes of
Distribution, Centesimal graduation of base.)

The third lesson passes from Variates,
measured upwards from the base, to Deviates
measured upwards or downwards from the
Median, and treated as positive or negative
values accordingly (Fig. 6).

Draw a Scheme of Variates on the blackboard,
and show that it consists of two parts;
the median which represents a constant, and
the curve which represents the variations
from it. Draw a horizontal line from limit to
limit, through the top of the Median to serve
as Axis to the Curve. Divide the Axis
centesimally, and wipe out everything except
Curve, Axis, and Limits. This forms a
Scheme of Distribution of Deviates. Draw
ordinates from the axis to the curve at the
25th and 75th divisions. These are the
‘Quartile’ deviates.

At this stage the Genesis of the theoretical
Normal curve might be briefly explained
and the generality of its application; also
some of its beautiful properties of reproduction.
Many of the diagrams already shown would
be again employed to show the prevalence of
approximately normal distributions. Exceptions
.bn p089.png
.pn +1
of strongly marked Skew curves would be
exhibited and their genesis briefly described.

It will then be explained that while the
ordinate at <em>any</em> specified centesimal division
in two normal curves of deviation measures
their relative variability, the Quartile is
commonly employed as the unit of variability
under the almost grotesque name of ‘Probable
Error,’ which is intended to signify that the
length of any Deviate in the system is as likely
as not to exceed or to fall short of it. This,
by construction, is the case of either Quartile.

(New words and meanings—Scheme of
Distribution of Deviates, Axis, Normal, Skew,
Quartile, and Probable Error.)

In the fourth lesson it has to be explained
that the Curve of Normal Distribution is not
a direct result of calculation, neither does
the formula that expresses it lend itself so
freely to further calculation, as the curve of
Frequency. Their shapes differ; the first is an
Ogive, the second (Fig. 7) is Bell-shaped. In
the curve of Frequency the Deviations are
reckoned from the Mean of all the Variates,
and not from the Median. Mean and Median
are the same in Normal Curves, but may
differ much in others. Either of these normal
curves can be transformed into the other,
as is best exemplified by using a Polygon
(Fig. 8) instead of the Curve, consisting
of a series of rectangles differing in
height by the same amounts, but having
widths respectively representative of the
.bn p090.png
.pn +1
frequencies of 1, 3, 3, 1. (This is one
of those known as a Binomial series, whose
genesis might be briefly explained.) If these
rectangles are arrayed in order of their widths,
side by side, they become the equivalents of
the ogival curve of Distribution. Now if each
of these latter rectangles be slid parallel to
itself up to either limit, their bases will
overlap and they become equivalent to the
bell-shaped curve of Frequency with its base
vertical.

The curve of Frequency contains no easily
perceived unit of variability like the Quartile
of the Curve of Distribution. It is therefore
not suited for and was not used as a first
illustration, but the formula that expresses it
is by far the more suitable of the two for calculation.
Its unit of variability is what is
called the ‘Standard Deviation,’ whose genesis
will admit of illustration. How the calculations
are made for finding its value is far beyond
the reach of the present lessons. The calculated
ordinates of the normal curve must be
accepted by the learner much as the time of
day by his watch, though he be ignorant of
the principles of its construction. Much further
beyond his reach are the formulae used to
express quasi-normal and skew curves. They
require a previous knowledge of rather
advanced mathematics.

(New words and ideas—Curve of Frequency,
Standard Deviation, Mean, Binomial
Series).
.bn p091.png
.pn +1

The fifth and last lesson deals with the
measurement of Correlation, that is, with the
closeness of the relation between any two
systems whose variations are due partly to
causes common to both, and partly to causes
special to each. It applies to nearly every
social relation, as to environment and
health, social position and fertility, the kinship
of parent to child, of uncle to nephew, &c. It
may be mechanically illustrated by the movements
of two pulleys with weights attached,
suspended from a cord held by one of the
hands of three different persons, 1, 2, and 3.
No. 2 holds the middle of the cord, one half
of which then passes round one of the pulleys
up to the hand of No. 1; the other half
similarly round the other pulley up to the
hand of No. 3. The hands of Nos. 1, 2, and
3 move up and down quite independently, but
as the movements of both weights are simultaneously
controlled in part by No. 2, they
become ‘correlated.’

The formation of a table of correlations
on paper ruled in squares, is easily explained
on the blackboard (Fig. 9). The pairs of
correlated values <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> have to be expressed
in units of their respective variabilities. They
are then sorted into the squares of the paper,—vertically
according to the magnitudes of <i>A</i>,
horizontally according to those of <i>B</i>—, and the
Mean of each partial array of <i>B</i> values,
corresponding to each grade of <i>A</i>, has to be
determined. It is found theoretically that
.bn p092.png
.pn +1
where variability is normal, the Means of <i>B</i>
lie practically in a straight line on the face
of the Table, and observation shows they do
so in most other cases. It follows that the
average deviation of a <i>B</i> value bears a constant
ratio to the deviation of the corresponding
<i>A</i> value. This ratio is called the ‘Index
of Correlation,’ and is expressed by a single
figure. For example: if the thigh-bone of
many persons deviate ‘very much’ from the
usual length of the thigh-bones of their race,
the average of the lengths of the corresponding
arm-bones will differ ‘much,’ but not
‘very much,’ from the usual length of arm-bones,
and the ratio between this ‘very
much’ and ‘much’ is constant and in the
same direction, whatever be the numerical
value attached to the word ‘very much.’
Lastly, the trustworthiness of the Index of
Correlation, when applied to individual cases,
is readily calculable. When the closeness of
correlation is absolute, it is expressed by the
number 1·0; and by 0·0, when the correlation
is nil.

(New words and ideas—Correlation and
Index of Correlation.)

This concludes what I have to say on
these suggested Object lessons. It will have
been tedious to follow in its necessarily much
compressed form,—but will serve, I trust, to
convey its main purpose of showing that a
very brief course of lessons, copiously illustrated
by diagrams and objects to handle,
.bn p093.png
.pn +1
would give an acceptable introduction to the
newer methods employed in Biometry and in
Eugenics. Further, that when read leisurely
by experts in its printed form, it would give
them sufficient guidance for elaborating details.

<sc>Influence of Collective Truths upon Individual Conduct.</sc>

We have thus far been concerned with
Probability, determined by methods that take
cognizance of Variations, and yield exact
results, thereby affording a solid foundation
for action. But the stage on which human
action takes place is a superstructure into
which emotion enters, we are guided on it less
by Certainties and by Probabilities than by
Assurance to a greater or lesser degree. The
word Assurance is derived from <em>sure</em>, which
itself is an abbreviation of <em>secure</em>, that is of
<em>se-\ cura</em>, or without misgiving. It is a contented
attitude of mind largely dependent on
custom, prejudice, or other unreasonable influences
which reformers have to overcome,
and some of which they are apt to utilize on
their own behalf. Human nature is such
that we rarely find our way by the pure light
of reason, but while peering through spectacles
furnished with coloured and distorting
glasses.

Locke seems to confound certainty with
assurance in his forcible description of the
way in which men are guided in their daily
affairs (<cite>Human Understanding</cite>, iv. 14, par. 1):
.bn p094.png
.pn +1

.ll -4
.fs 85%
Man would be at a great loss if he had nothing to
direct him but what has the certainty of true knowledge.
For that being very short and scanty, he would be
often utterly in the dark, and in most of the actions of
his life, perfectly at a stand, had he nothing to guide him
in the absence of clear and certain knowledge. He that
will not eat till he has demonstration that it will nourish
him, he that will not stir till he infallibly knows the
business he goes about will succeed, will have little else
to do than to sit still and perish.

A society may be considered as a highly
complex organism, with a consciousness of
its own, caring only for itself, establishing
regulations and customs for its collective
advantage, and creating a code of opinions to
subserve that end. It is hard to over-rate its
power over the individual in regard to any
obvious particular on which it emphatically
insists. I trust in some future time that one
of those particulars will be the practice of
Eugenics. Otherwise the influence of collective
truths on individual conduct is deplorably
weak, as expressed by the lines:--

For others’ follies teach us not,
Nor much their wisdom teaches,
But chief of solid worth is what
Our own experience preaches.

.fs

Professor Westermarck, among many other
remarks in which I fully concur, has aptly
stated (<cite>Sociological Papers</cite>, published for the
Sociological Society. Macmillan, 1906, vol.
ii., p. 24), with reference to one obstacle which
prevents individuals from perceiving the importance
.bn p095.png
.pn +1
of Eugenics, ‘the prevalent opinion
that almost anybody is good enough to marry
is chiefly due to the fact that in this case,
cause and effect, marriage and the feebleness
of the offspring, are so distant from each other
that the <em>near-sighted eye</em> does not distinctly
perceive the connexion between them.’ (The
Italics are mine.)

The enlightenment of individuals is a
necessary preamble to practical Eugenics, but
social opinion is the tyrant by whose praise
or blame the principles of Eugenics may be
expected hereafter to influence individual
conduct. Public opinion may, however, be
easily directed into different channels by
opportune pressure. A common conviction
that change in the established order of some
particular codes of conduct would be impossible,
because of the shock that the idea of
doing so gives to our present ideas, bears some
resemblance to the conviction of lovers that
their present sentiments will endure for ever.
Conviction, which is that very Assurance of
which mention has just been made, is proved
by reiterated experience to be a highly
fallacious guide. Love is notoriously fickle
in despite of the fervent and genuine protestations
of lovers, and so is public opinion.
I gave a list of extraordinary variations of the
latter in respect to restrictions it enforced on
the freedom of marriage, at various times and
places (<cite>Sociological Papers</cite>, quoted above).
Much could be added to that list, but I will
.bn p096.png
.pn +1
not now discuss the effects of public opinion
on such a serious question. I will take a
much smaller instance which occurred before
the time to which the recollections of most
persons can now reach, but which I myself
recall vividly. It is the simple matter of hair
on the face of male adults. When I was
young, it was an unpardonable offence for any
English person other than a cavalry officer, or
perhaps someone of high social rank, to wear
a moustache. Foreigners did so and were
tolerated, otherwise the assumption of a
moustache was in popular opinion worse than
wicked, for it was atrociously bad style. Then
came the Crimean War and the winter of
Balaclava, during which it was cruel to
compel the infantry to shave themselves every
morning. So their beards began to grow, and
this broke a long established custom. On
the return of the army to England the fashion
of beards spread among the laity, but
stopped short of the clergy. These, however,
soon began to show dissatisfaction; they said
the beard was a sign of manliness that ought
not to be suppressed, and so forth, and at
length the moment arrived. A distinguished
clergyman, happily still living, ‘bearded’ his
Bishop on a critical occasion. The Bishop
yielded without protest, and forthwith hair
began to sprout in a thousand pulpits where
it had never appeared before within the
memory of man.

It would be no small shock to public
.bn p097.png
.pn +1
sentiment if our athletes in running public
races were to strip themselves stark naked,
yet that custom was rather suddenly introduced
into Greece. Plato says (Republic V,
par. 452, Jowett’s translation):

.in +4
.ll -4
.fs 85%
Not long ago the Greeks were of the opinion,
which is still generally received among the barbarians,
that the sight of a naked man was ridiculous and
improper, and when first the Cretans and the Lacedaemonians
introduced naked exercises, the wits of that
day might have ridiculed them....
.fs
.ll
.in

Thucydides (I. 6) also refers to the same
change as occurring ‘quite lately’.

Public opinion is commonly far in advance
of private morality, because society as a
whole keenly appreciates acts that tend to
its advantage, and condemns those that do
not. It applauds acts of heroism that perhaps
not one of the applauders would be
disposed to emulate. It is instructive to
observe cases in which the benevolence of
public opinion has out-stripped that of the
Law—which, for example, takes no notice of
such acts as are enshrined in the parable of
the good Samaritan. A man on his journey
was robbed, wounded and left by the wayside.
A priest and a Levite successively pass by and
take no heed of him. A Samaritan follows,
takes pity, binds his wounds, and bears him to
a place of safety. Public opinion keenly
condemns the priest and the Levite, and
praises the Samaritan, but our criminal law is
indifferent to such acts. It is most severe on
.bn p098.png
.pn +1
misadventure due to the neglect of a definite
duty, but careless about those due to the
absence of common philanthropy. Its callousness
in this respect is painfully shown in
the following quotations (Kenny, <cite>Outlines of
Criminal Law</cite>, 1902, p. 121, per Hawkins in
Reg. v. Paine, <cite>Times</cite>, February 25, 1880):

It appears, from a footnote, that this case
has been discussed in a striking manner by
Lord Macaulay in his notes on the Indian
Penal Code, which I have not yet been able
to consult.

Enough has been written elsewhere by myself
and others to show that whenever public
opinion is strongly roused it will lead to
action, however contradictory it may be to
previous custom and sentiment. Considering
that public opinion is guided by the sense of
what best serves the interests of society as a
.bn p099.png

whole, it is reasonable to expect that it will
be strongly exerted in favour of Eugenics
when a sufficiency of evidence shall have been
collected to make the truths on which it rests
plain to all. That moment has not yet
arrived. Enough is already known to those
who have studied the question to leave no
doubt in their minds about the general results,
but not enough is quantitatively known to
justify legislation or other action except in
extreme cases. Continued studies will be
required for some time to come, and the pace
must not be hurried. When the desired fulness
of information shall have been acquired
then, and not till then, will be the fit moment
to proclaim a ‘Jehad,’ or Holy War against
customs and prejudices that impair the
physical and moral qualities of our race.

LOCAL ASSOCIATIONS FOR PROMOTING EUGENICS[#]

I propose to take the present opportunity
of submitting some views of my own relating
to that large province of eugenics which is
concerned with favouring the families of
those who are exceptionally fit for citizenship.
Consequently, little or nothing will be said
relating to what has been well termed by
Dr. Saleeby “negative” eugenics, namely,
the hindrance of the marriages and the production
of offspring by the exceptionally
unfit. The latter is unquestionably the more
pressing subject of the two, but it will soon
be forced on the attention of the legislature
by the recent report of the Royal Commission
on the Feeble-minded. We may be content
to await for awhile the discussions to which
it will give rise, and which I am sure the
members of this society will follow with keen
interest, and with readiness to intervene when
what may be advanced seems likely to result
in actions of an anti-eugenic character.

The remarks I am about to make were
suggested by hearing of a desire to further
eugenics by means of local associations more
or less affiliated to our own, combined with
.bn p101.png
.pn +1
much doubt as to the most appropriate
methods of establishing and conducting them.
It is upon this very important branch of our
wide subject that I propose to offer a few
remarks.

It is difficult, while explaining what I
have in view, to steer a course that shall keep
clear of the mud flats of platitude on the one
hand, and not come to grief against the rocks
of over-precision on the other. There is no
clear issue out of mere platitudes, while there
is great danger in entering into details. A
good scheme may be entirely compromised
merely on account of public opinion not being
ripe to receive it in the proposed form, or
through a discovered flaw in some non-essential
part of it. Experience shows that
the safest course in a new undertaking is to
proceed warily and tentatively towards the
desired end, rather than freely and rashly
along a predetermined route, however carefully
it may have been elaborated on paper.

Again, whatever scheme of action is
proposed for adoption must be neither
Utopian nor extravagant, but accordant
throughout with British sentiment and
practice.

The successful establishment of any
general system of constructive eugenics will,
in my view (which I put forward with
diffidence), depend largely upon the efforts
of local associations acting in close harmony
with a central society, like our own. A
.bn p102.png
.pn +1
prominent part of its business will then consist
in affording opportunities for the interchange
of ideas and for the registration and comparison
of results. Such a central society would
tend to bring about a general uniformity of
administration the value of which is so obvious
that I do not stop to insist on it.

Assuming, as I do, that the powers at the
command of the local associations will be
almost purely social, let us consider how those
associations might be formed and conducted
so as to become exceedingly influential.

It is necessary to be somewhat precise at
the outset, so I will begin with the by no
means improbable supposition that in a given
district a few individuals, some of them of
local importance, are keenly desirous of starting
a local association or society, and are
prepared to take trouble to that end. How
should they set to work?

Their initial step would seem to be to
form themselves into a provisional executive
committee, and to nominate a president,
council, and other officers of the new society.
This done, the society in question, though it
would have no legal corporate existence, may
be taken as formed.

The committee would next provide, with
the aid of the central society, for a few sane
and sensible lectures to be given on eugenics,
including the A B C of heredity, at some
convenient spot, and they would exert themselves
to arouse a wide interest in the subjects
.bn p103.png
.pn +1
by making it known in the district. They
would seek the co-operation of the local
medical men, clergy, and lawyers, of the
sanitary authorities, and of all officials whose
administrative duties bring them into contact
with various classes of society, and they would
endeavour to collect round this nucleus that
portion of the local community which was
likely to be brought into sympathy with the
eugenic cause. Every political organisation,
every philanthropic agency, proceeds on some
such lines as I have just sketched out.

The committee might next issue, on the
part of the president and council of the new
society, a series of invitations to guests at
their social gatherings, where differences of
rank should be studiously ignored. The
judicious management of these gatherings
would, of course, require considerable tact,
but there are abundant precedents for them,
among which I need only mention the meetings
of the Primrose League at one end of
the scale, and those held in Toynbee Hall at
the other end. Given a not inclement day,
an hour suitable to the occasion, a park or
large garden to meet in, these informal yet
select reunions might be made exceedingly
pleasant, and very helpful to the eugenic
cause.

The inquiries made by the committee
when they were considering the names of
strangers to whom invitations ought to be
sent, would put them in possession of a large
.bn p104.png
.pn +1
fund of information concerning the qualities
of many notable individuals in their district,
and their family histories. These family
histories should be utilised for eugenic studies,
and it should be the duty of the local council
to cause them to be tabulated in an orderly
way, and to communicate the more significant
of them to the central society.

The chief of the notable qualities, to
which I refer in the preceding paragraph, is
the possession of what I will briefly call by
the general term of “Worth.” By this I
mean the civic worthiness, or the value to the
State, of a person, as it would probably be
assessed by experts, or, say, by such of his
fellow-workers as have earned the respect of
the community in the midst of which they
live. Thus the worth of soldiers would be
such as it would be rated by respected soldiers,
students by students, business men by business
men, artists by artists, and so on. The State
is a vastly complex organism, and the hope
of obtaining a proportional representation of
its best parts should be an avowed object of
issuing invitations to these gatherings.

Speaking only for myself, if I had to
classify persons according to worth, I should
consider each of them under the three heads
of physique, ability, and character, subject to
the provision that inferiority in any one of the
three should outweigh superiority in the other
two. I rank physique first, because it is not
only very valuable in itself and allied to many
.bn p105.png
.pn +1
other good qualities, but has the additional
merit of being easily rated. Ability I should
place second on similar grounds, and character
third, though in real importance it stands
first of all. It is very difficult to rate character
justly; the tenure of a position of trust is only
a partial test of it, though a good one so far
as it goes. Again, I wish to say emphatically
that in what I have thrown out I have no
desire to impose my own judgment on others,
especially as I feel persuaded that almost any
intelligent committee would so distribute their
invitations to strangers as to include most,
though perhaps not all, of the notable persons
in the district.

By the continued action of local associations
as described thus far, a very large
amount of good work in eugenics would be
incidentally done. Family histories would
become familiar topics, the existence of good
stocks would be discovered, and many persons
of “worth” would be appreciated and made
acquainted with each other who were formerly
known only to a very restricted circle. It is
probable that these persons, in their struggle
to obtain appointments, would often receive
valuable help from local sympathisers with
eugenic principles. If local societies did no
more than this for many years to come, they
would have fully justified their existence by
their valuable services.

A danger to which these societies will be
liable arises from the inadequate knowledge
.bn p106.png
.pn +1
joined to great zeal of some of the most active
among their probable members. It may be
said, without mincing words, with regard to
much that has already been published, that
the subject of eugenics is particularly
attractive to “cranks.” The councils of local
societies will therefore be obliged to exercise
great caution before accepting the memoirs
offered to them, and much discretion in
keeping discussions within the bounds of
sobriety and common sense. The basis of
eugenics is already firmly established, namely,
that the offspring of “worthy” parents are, <em>on
the whole</em>, more highly gifted by nature with
faculties that conduce to “worthiness” than
the offspring of less “worthy” parents. On
the other hand, forecasts in respect to
particular cases may be quite wrong. They
have to be based on imperfect data. It cannot
be too emphatically repeated that a great deal
of careful statistical work has yet to be
accomplished before the science of eugenics
can make large advances.

I hesitate to speculate farther. A tree
will have been planted; let it grow. Perhaps
those who may thereafter feel themselves or
be considered by others to be the possessors
of notable eugenic qualities—let us for brevity
call them “Eugenes”—will form their own
clubs and look after their own interests. It
is impossible to foresee what the state of
public opinion will then be. Many elements
of strength are needed, many dangers have to
.bn p107.png
.pn +1
be evaded or overcome, before associations of
Eugenes could be formed that would be stable
in themselves, useful as institutions, and
approved of by the outside world.

The suggestion I made in the earlier
part of this paper that the executive committee
of local associations should co-operate, wherever
practicable, with local administrative
authorities, proceeded on the assumption that
the inhabitants of the districts selected as the
eugenic “field” had a public spirit of their
own and a sense of common interest. This
sense would be greatly strengthened by the
enlargement of mutual acquaintanceship and
the spread of the eugenic idea consequent on
the tactful action of the committee. It ought
not to be difficult to arouse in the inhabitants
a just pride in their own civic worthiness,
analogous to the pride which a soldier feels
in the good reputation of his regiment or a
lad in that of his school. By this means a
strong local eugenic opinion might easily be
formed. It would be silently assisted by local
object lessons, in which the benefits derived
through following eugenic rules and the bad
effects of disregarding them were plainly to
be discerned.

The power of social opinion is apt to be
underrated rather then overrated. Like the
atmosphere which we breathe and in which
we move, social opinion operates powerfully
without our being conscious of its weight.
Everyone knows that governments, manners,
.bn p108.png
.pn +1
and beliefs which were thought to be right,
decorous, and true at one period have been
judged wrong, indecorous, and false at
another; and that views which we have heard
expressed by those in authority over us in our
childhood and early manhood tend to become
axiomatic and unchangeable in mature life.

In circumscribed communities especially,
social approval and disapproval exert a potent
force. Its presence is only too easily read by
those who are the object of either, in the
countenances, bearing, and manner of persons
whom they daily meet and converse with. Is
it, then, I ask, too much to expect that when
a public opinion in favour of eugenics has
once taken sure hold of such communities and
has been accepted by them as a quasi-religion,
the result will be manifested in sundry and
very effective modes of action which are as
yet untried, and many of them even unforeseen?

Speaking for myself only, I look forward
to local eugenic action in numerous directions,
of which I will now specify one. It is the
accumulation of considerable funds to start
young couples of “worthy” qualities in their
married life, and to assist them and their
families at critical times. The gifts to those
who are the reverse of “worthy” are enormous
in amount; it is stated that the charitable
donations or bequests in the year 1907
amounted to 4,868,050<i>l.</i> I am not prepared
to say how much of this was judiciously spent,
.bn p109.png
.pn +1
or in what ways, but merely quote the figures
to justify the inference that many of the
thousands of persons who are willing to give
freely at the prompting of a sentiment based
upon compassion might be persuaded to give
largely also in response to the more virile
desire of promoting the natural gifts and the
national efficiency of future generations.
